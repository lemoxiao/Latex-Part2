\chapter{Complex inner product vector spaces}
\label{ch:cipvs}

\minitoc

The previous chapters explored many beautiful patterns in the linear algebra of real vectors and matrices.
These same patterns are seen time and time again: in the differential equations of engineering and science; in the complex matrices of quantum physics; and in the dynamics of time delay systems in biology.
But to use our powerful results in these areas we need to extend  linear algebra to complex vectors\slash matrices and to `infinite' dimensions.

Suggest not to include in a first version.

Plan to cover at a more abstract level \pooliv{Ch.6 and~7} \larsvii{Ch.5 and~8} \holti{Ch.10, \S11.4--5}:
\begin{itemize}
\item def (complex) vector space, incl functions
\item inner products and norms, incl integrals, basic orthog polys
\item generalised symmetric eigenproblem \(A\xv=\lambda B\xv\) and orthog with weighted inner product
\item linear transforms, range, kernel, with calculus applications
\item unitary matrices (poss quantum physics appl)
\item \svd: solutions and approximations
\item eigenproblem, linear independence, generalised eigenvectors, basis, change of basis, relate to FT, Hermitian matrices
\end{itemize}
