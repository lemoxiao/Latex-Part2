\chapter{Approximate matrices}
\label{ch:am}

\minitoc



This
\begin{aside}
This chapter could be studied any time after \autoref{ch:m} to help the transition to more abstract linear algebra.  
Useful as spaced revision of the \svd, rank, orthogonality, and so~on.
\end{aside}%
chapter develops how concepts associated with \idx{length} and \idx{distance} applies to matrices as well as vectors.  
More advanced courses on Linear Algebra place these in a unifying framework that also encompasses much you see both in solving differential equations (and integral equations) and in problems involving complex numbers (such as those in electrical engineering or quantum physics). 



\begin{comment} 
Huge applications of \svd{}s to video compression, experimental errors, and other areas.
Introduce digital \idx{image compression} by \svd{}s \pooliv{p.607--8} \holti{p.336--7}  \cite[\S07]{Davis99a}.
\cite{Higham86} mentions applications of \idx{polar decomposition} to the Orthogonal Procrustes problem.
