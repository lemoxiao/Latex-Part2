The most fundamental laws of physics are conservation laws, which tell us that we can't
create or destroy ``stuff,'' where ``stuff'' could mean quantities such as electric
charge or energy-momentum. Since charge is a Lorentz invariant, it's an easy example
to start with. Because charge is invariant, we might also imagine that charge density
$\rho$ was invariant. But this is not the case, essentially because spatial (3-dimensional)
volume isn't invariant; in $3+1$ dimensions, only \emph{four}-dimensional volume is
an invariant (problem \ref{hw:no-transverse-length-contraction}, 
p.~\pageref{hw:no-transverse-length-contraction}). For example, suppose we have an
insulator in the shape of a cube, with charge distributed uniformly throughout it
according to an observer $\vc{o}_1$ at rest relative to the cube. Then in a frame 
$\vc{o}_2$ moving relative
to the cube, parallel to one of its axes, the cube becomes foreshortened by length
contraction, and its volume is reduced by the factor $1/\gamma$. The result is that
the charge density in $\vc{o}_2$ is greater by a factor of $\gamma$. 

This means that
knowledge of the charge density $\rho$ in one frame is insufficient to determine the charge
density in another frame. In the example of the cube, what would be sufficient would
be knowledge of the vector $\vc{J}=\rho_0\vc{v}$, where $\rho_0$ is the charge density
in the cube's rest frame, and $\vc{v}$ is the cube's velocity vector. $\vc{J}$, called
the current vector,\index{current vector}
transforms
as a relativistic vector because of the transformation properties of the two factors
that define it. The velocity $\vc{v}$ is a vector (section \ref{subsec:v-vector}). The
factor $\rho_0$ is an invariant, since it in turn breaks down into charge divided by
rest-volume. Charge is an invariant, and
all observers agree on what the volume the cube \emph{would} have in its rest frame.

<% end_marg %>

$\vc{J}$ can be expressed in Minkowski coordinates as $(\rho,J^x,J^y,J^z)$, where
$\rho$ is the charge density and, e.g., $J^x$ is the density of electric current in the
$x$ direction. Suppose we define the three-surface $S$ shown in figure
\subfigref{fluxes-of-charge}{1}, consisting of the set of events
with coordinates $(t,0,y,z)$ such that $0\le t\le 1$, $0\le y \le 1$, and $0\le z \le 1$.
Some charged particles have world-lines that intersect this surface, passing through it
either in the positive $x$ direction or the negative $x$ direction (which we count
as negative charge transport). $S$ has a three-volume $V$. If we add up the total
charge transport $\Delta q$ across this surface and divide by $V$, we get the average
value of $J^x$. If we let $S$ shrink down to smaller and smaller three-surfaces surrounding
the event $(0,0,0,0)$, then we get the the value of $J^x$ at this point, $\lim_{V\rightarrow0} \Delta q/V$.
In other words, $J^x$ measures the \emph{flux density} of charge that passes through $S$.
Of course this description in terms of a limit implies a large number of charges, not just
one as in figure \figref{fluxes-of-charge}.

You can write out the analogous definition for $J^t$, using a surface of simultaneity for like $S'$,
figure \subfigref{fluxes-of-charge}{2},
and you'll see that it expresses the density of charge $\rho$. In this case $S'$ represents a
moment in time, and the flux through $S'$ means that
the charges are crossing the threshold from the past into the future.

Our argument that $\vc{J}$ transformed like a vector was based on a case where all
the charged particles had the same velocity vector, but the above description in terms
of the flux of charge eliminated any discussion of velocity.
It's true, but less obvious, that the $\vc{J}$ described in this way also transforms
as a vector, even in cases where the charged
particles do not all have parallel world-lines.
The current vector is the source of electric and magnetic fields.
Remarkably, no macroscopic electrical measurement is
capable of detecting anything more detailed about the motion of the charges than the
averaged information provided by $\vc{J}$.

\begin{eg}{Boosting a solenoid}\label{eg:boost-solenoid}
The figure shows a solenoid, at rest, wound from copper wire.
At point P, we construct a rectangular Amp\`erian
loop in the $yz$ plane that has its right edge inside the solenoid and its left one outside.
Amp\`ere's law,
$\int \vc{B}\cdot\der\vc{s}=(4\pi k/c^2)I$, then tells us that
the current density $J_x$ causes a difference between the exterior field $B_z=0$ and
the interior field $B_z=(4\pi k/c^2)J_x \Delta y$, where $\Delta y$ is the thickness
of the solenoid. There are two things we can get from this result, both of them
nontrivial.
<% marg(30) %>
<%
  fig(
    'boost-solenoid',
    %q{Example \ref{eg:boost-solenoid}.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

First, the field depends only on the current density, not on any information about the
details of the motion of the electrons in the copper. The electrons' motion is fast and highly
random, but all that contributes to $J_x$ is the slow drift velocity, typically $\sim1\ \zu{cm}/\sunit$,
superimposed on the randomness. This is exact and not at all obvious. For example, the total \emph{momentum}
of the electrons \emph{does} depend on the random part of their motion, because $p_x=m\gamma v_x$ has
a factor of $\gamma$ in it.

Second, we can use the transformation properties of the current vector to find
the field of this solenoid in a frame boosted along its axis. This is the kind of
situation that would naturally arise, for example, in an electric motor whose rotor
contains an electromagnet. A Lorentz transformation
in the $z$ direction doesn't change the $x$ component of a vector, nor does it change
$\Delta y$, so $B_z$ is the same
in both frames. This is nontrivial both in the sense that it would have been difficult
to figure out by brute force and in the sense that fields \emph{don't} have to be the
same in different frames of reference --- for example, a boost in the $x$ or the $y$ direction
would have changed the result.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A wire}\label{eg:wire-four-current}
In a solid conductor such as a copper wire, we have two types of charges, protons and electrons.
The protons are at rest in the lab frame $\vc{o}$, with charge density $\rho_p$ and current density
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{J}_p = (\rho_p,0,0,0)
\end{equation*}
in Minkowski coordinates.
The motion of the electrons is complicated. Some electrons
are bound to a particular atom, but still move at relativistic speeds within their atoms. Others
exhibit violent thermal motion that very nearly, but not quite, averages out to zero when there is
a current measurable by an ammeter. For simplicity, we treat all the electrons (both the bound ones
and the mobile ones) as a single density of charge $\rho_e$. Let the average velocity of the electrons,
known as their drift velocity, be $v$ in the $x$ direction. Then in the frame $\vc{o}'$ moving along
with the drift velocity we have
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{J}'_e = (\rho_e',0,0,0)\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which under a Lorentz transformation back into the lab frame becomes
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{J}_e = (\rho_e' \gamma,\rho_e' v \gamma,0,0)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Adding the two current vectors, we have a total current in the lab frame
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{J} = (\rho_p+\rho_e' \gamma,\rho_e' v \gamma,0,0)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The wire is electrically neutral in this frame, so $\rho_p+\rho_e' \gamma=0$. Since $\rho_p$ is a fixed
property of the wire, we express $\rho_e'$ in terms of it as $\rho_p/\gamma$. Eliminating $\rho_e'$ gives
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{J} = (0,-\rho_p v ,0,0)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Because the $\gamma$ factors canceled, we find that the current is exactly proportional to the
drift velocity. Geometrically, we have added two timelike vectors and gotten a spacelike one;
this is possible because one of the timelike vectors was future-directed and the other
past-directed.
\end{eg}

<% end_sec('current-as-flux') %>

<% begin_sec("Conservation of charge",4,'conservation-of-charge') %>

Conservation of charge can be expressed elegantly in terms of $\vc{J}$. Charge density
is the timelike component $J^t$. If this charge density near a certain point is, for example, increasing,
then it might be because charge conservation has been violated as
in figure \subfigref{charge-conservation}{1}. In this example,
more world-lines emerge into the future at the top of the four-cube than had entered through the bottom
in the past. Some process inside the cube is creating charge.
In the limit where the cube is made very small, this would be measured by
a value of $\partial J^t/\partial t$ that was greater than zero.

<% marg(30) %>
<%
  fig(
    'charge-conservation',
    %q{1. Charge is not conserved. Charges mysteriously appear at a later time without having been present
       before. 2. Charge is conserved. Although more world-lines come out through the top of the box than
       came in through the bottom, the discrepancy is accounted for by others that entered through the sides.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

But experiments have never detected any violation of charge conservation, so if
more charge is emerging from the top (future) side of the cube than came in from the bottom (past),
the more likely explanation is that the charges are not all at rest, as in \subfigref{charge-conservation}{1},
but are moving, \subfigref{charge-conservation}{2}, and there has been a net flow in from 
neighboring regions of
space.
We should find this reflected
in the spatial components $J^x$, $J^y$ and $J^z$. Moreover, if these spatial components
were all constant, then any given region of space would have just as much current flowing into
it from one side as there was flowing out the other. We therefore need to have
some nonzero partial derivatives such as $\partial J^x/\partial x$. 
For example, figure \subfigref{charge-conservation}{2} has a positive $J^x$ on the left
and a negative $J^x$ on the right, so $\partial J^x/\partial x<0$.
Charge conservation is expressed by the simple equation
$\partial J^\lambda/\partial x^\lambda=0$. Writing out the implied sum over $\lambda$, this
says that $\partial J^t/\partial t+\partial J^x/\partial x+\partial J^y/\partial y+\partial J^z/\partial z=0$.
with an implied sum over the index $\lambda$. If you've taken vector calculus, you'll
recognize the
operator being applied to $\vc{J}$ as a four-dimensional generalization of the
divergence.\label{divergence}\index{divergence}
This charge-conservation equation is valid regardless of the coordinate system,
so it can also be rewritten in abstract index notation as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial J^a}{\partial x^a} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation}

\begin{eg}{Conservation of charge in a solenoid}
In a solenoid, we have charge circulating at some drift velocity $v$. Ignoring the protons,
and adapting the relevant expression from example \ref{eg:wire-four-current} to the case of
circular rather than linear motion,
we might have for the electrons' contribution to the current something of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{J} = p (1,-qy,qx,0)\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $p=\gamma v$ and $q$ depends on the $v$ and on the radius of the solenoid.
Conservation of charge is satisfied, because each of the four terms
in the equation 
$\partial J^t/\partial t+\partial J^x/\partial x+\partial J^y/\partial y+\partial J^z/\partial z=0$
vanishes individually.

<% begin_sec("The stress-energy tensor",4,'stress-energy') %>
<% begin_sec("Conservation and flux of energy-momentum",nil,'p-flux') %>
A particle such as an electron has a charge, but it also has a mass. We can't define a relativistic
mass flux because flux is defined by addition, but mass isn't additive in relativity
(example \ref{eg:mass-of-two-light-waves}, p.~\pageref{eg:mass-of-two-light-waves}).
Mass-energy is additive, but unlike charge it isn't an invariant. Mass-energy is part
of the energy-momentum four vector $\vc{p}=(E,p^x,p^y,p^z)$. We then have sixteen
different fluxes we can define. For example, we could replay the description 
in section \ref{sec:j-vector} of the three-surface $S$ perpendicular to the $x$ direction,
but now we would be interested in a quantity such as the $z$ component of momentum.
We then have a measure of the density of flux of $p^z$ in the $x$ direction, which we
notate as $T^{zx}$. The matrix $T$ is called the stress-energy tensor,
and it is an object of central importance in relativity.\index{stress-energy tensor}
(The reason for the odd name will become more clear in a moment.)
In general relativity, it is the source of gravitational fields.

The stress-energy tensor is related to physical measurements as follows.
Let $\vc{o}$ be the future-directed, normalized velocity vector of an observer; let $\vc{s}$ express
a spatial direction according to this observer, i.e., it points in a direction
of simultaneity and is normalized with $\vc{s}\cdot\vc{s}=-1$;
and let $\vc{S}$ be a three-volume covector (p.~\pageref{three-vol-covector}), directed toward
the future (i.e., $o^aS_a>0$). Then measurements by this observer come out as follows:
\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:stress-energy-measurements}
\begin{align}
  T^{ab}o_a S_b &= \text{mass-energy inside the three-volume $\vc{S}$} \label{eqn:stress-energy-e-meas}\\
  T^{ab}s_a S_b &= \text{momentum in the direction $\vc{s}$, inside $\vc{S}$} 
                                                                       \label{eqn:stress-energy-p-meas}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The stress-energy tensor allows us to express
conservation of energy-momentum as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stress-energy-div-zero}
  \frac{\partial T^{ab}}{\partial x^a} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation}
This \emph{local} conservation of energy-momentum is all we get in general relativity. As discussed
in section \ref{subsec:gr-no-e-cons}, p.~\pageref{subsec:gr-no-e-cons}, there is no such
global law in curved spacetime. However, we will show in section
\ref{subsec:p-vector} that in the special case of flat spacetime, i.e., special relativity,
we do have such a global conservation law.
<% end_sec('p-flux') %>
<% begin_sec("Symmetry of the stress-energy tensor",nil,'stress-energy-symm') %>
The stress-energy tensor is a symmetric matrix.
For example, let's say we have some nonrelativistic particles. If we
have a nonzero $T^{tx}$, it represents a flux of mass-energy ($p^t$) through a three-surface
perpendicular to $x$. This means that mass is moving in the $x$ direction. But if mass
is moving in the $x$ direction, then we have some $x$ momentum $p^x$. Therefore we must also
have a $T^{xt}$, since this momentum is carried by the particles, whose world-lines pass through
a hypersurface of simultaneity.
<% end_sec('stress-energy-symm') %>
<% begin_sec("Dust",nil,'dust') %>
The simplest example of a stress-energy tensor would be a cloud of particles, all at rest
in a certain frame of reference, described in Minkowski coordinates:
\begin{equation*}
  T^{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
    \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
  \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where we now use $\rho$ to indicate the density of mass-energy, not charge as in section
\ref{sec:j-vector}. This could be the stress-energy tensor of a stack of oranges at the
grocery store, the atoms in a hunk of copper, or the galaxies in some small neighborhood of the universe.
Relativists refer to this type of matter, in which the velocities are negligible, as ``dust.''\index{dust}
The nonvanishing component $T^{tt}$ indicates that for a three-surface
$S$ perpendicular to the $t$ axis, particles with mass-energy $E=P^t$ are crossing that
surface from the past to the future.
Conservation of energy-momentum is satisfied, since all the elements of this $T$ are constant,
so all the partial derivatives vanish.
<% end_sec('dust') %>

<% begin_sec("Rank-2 tensors and their transformation law",nil,'rank-two') %>
Suppose we were to look at this cloud in a different frame of reference. Some or all of the timelike
row $T^{t\nu}$ and timelike column $T^{\mu t}$ would fill in because of the existence of
momentum, but let's just focus for the moment on the change in the mass-energy density
represented by $T^{tt}$. It will increase for two reasons. First, the kinetic energy
of each particle is now nonzero; its mass-energy increases from $m$ to $m\gamma$. But
in addition, the volume occupied by the cloud has been reduced by $1/\gamma$ due to length
contraction. We've picked up two factors of gamma, so the result is $\rho\rightarrow\rho\gamma^2$.
This is different from the transformation behavior of a vector. When a vector is purely
timelike in one frame, transformation to another frame raises its timelike component only by
a factor of $\gamma$, not $\gamma^2$. This tells us that a matrix like $T$ transforms differently
than a vector (section \ref{sec:xfn-vectors}, p.~\pageref{sec:xfn-vectors}). The general rule is that
if we transform from coordinates $x$ to $x'$, then:\label{rank-two-xfn}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rank-two-xfn}
  T'^{\mu\nu} = T^{\kappa\lambda} 
                   \frac{\partial x'^\mu}{\partial x^\kappa}
                   \frac{\partial x'^\nu}{\partial x^\lambda}
\end{equation}
An object that transforms in this standard way is called a rank-2 tensor. The 2 is because it
has two indices. Vectors and covectors have rank 1, invariants rank 0.\index{tensor!rank}

In section
\ref{sec:xfn-metric}, p.~\pageref{sec:xfn-metric}, we developed a method of transforming the
metric from one set of coordinates to another; we now see that technique as an application
of the more general rule given in equation \eqref{eqn:rank-two-xfn}. Considered as a tensor,
the metric is symmetric, $g_{ab}=g_{ba}$. In most of the example's we've been considering, the
metric tensor is diagonal, but when it has off-diagonal elements, each of these is one half
the corresponding coefficient in the expression for $\der s$, as in the following example.

\begin{eg}{An non-diagonal metric tensor}
The answer to problem \ref{hw:oblique-metric} on p.~\pageref{hw:oblique-metric} was the
metric
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der x^2 + \der y^2 + 2\cos\varphi\der x\der y\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Writing this in terms of the metric tensor, we have
\begin{align*}
  \der s^2 &= g_{\mu\nu} \der x^\mu \der x^\nu \\
           &= g_{xx} \der x^2 + g_{xy} \der x\der y + g_{yx} \der y \der x + g_{yy} \der y^2 \\
           &= g_{xx} \der x^2 + 2g_{xy} \der x\der y + g_{yy} \der y^2\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Therefore we have $g_{xy}=\cos\varphi$, not $g_{xy}=2\cos\varphi$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Dust in a different frame}\label{eg:dust-stress-energy}
We start with the stress-energy tensor of the cloud of particles, in the rest frame of the particles.
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^\mu^\nu} = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0    
      \end{matrix} \right)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Under a boost by $ v $ in the $x$ direction, the tensor transformation law gives
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu'}^{\nu'}} = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   \gamma^2\rho & \gamma^2 v \rho & 0 & 0 \\
                   \gamma^2 v \rho & \gamma^2 v ^2\rho & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0    
      \end{matrix} \right)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The over-all factor of $\gamma^2$ arises for the reasons previously described.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Parity}\label{eg:stress-energy-parity}
The parity transformation is a change of coordinates that looks like this:
\begin{align*}
  t' &= t \\
  x' &= -x \\
  y' &= -y \\
  z' &= -z
\end{align*}
It turns right-handed screws into left-handed ones, but leaves the arrow of time unchanged.
Under this transformation, the tensor transformation law tells us that some of the components
of the stress-energy tensor will flip their signs, while others will stay the same:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \text{no flip} & \text{flip} & \text{flip} & \text{flip} \\
    \text{flip} & \text{no flip} & \text{no flip} & \text{no flip} \\
    \text{flip} & \text{no flip} & \text{no flip} & \text{no flip} \\
    \text{flip} & \text{no flip} & \text{no flip} & \text{no flip} 
  \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
Everything here was based solely on the fact that $T$ was a rank-2 tensor expressed in
Minkowski coordinates, and therefore
the same parity properties hold for other rank-2 tensors as well; cf.~example
\ref{eg:e-b-parity}, p.~\pageref{eg:e-b-parity}.
\end{eg}

<% end_sec('rank-two') %>
<% begin_sec("Pressure",nil,'pressure') %>
The stress-energy tensor carries information about pressure. For example,
$T\indices{^x^x}$ is the flux in the $x$ direction
of $x$-momentum. This is simply the pressure, $P$, that would be exerted on a surface with its normal
in the $x$ direction. Negative pressure is tension, and this is the origin of the term ``tensor,''
coined by Levi-Civita (see p.~\pageref{fig:levi-civita-portrait}).\index{Levi-Civita, Tullio}

\begin{eg}{Pressure as a source of gravitational fields}
Because the stress-energy tensor is the source of gravitational fields in general relativity,
we can see that the gravitational field of an object should be influenced not just by its
mass-energy but by its internal stresses. The very early universe was dominated by photons rather
than by matter, and photons have a much higher ratio of momentum to mass-energy than matter,
so the importance of the pressure components in the stress-energy tensor was much greater in
that era. In the universe today, the largest pressures are those
found inside atomic nuclei. Inside a heavy nucleus, the electromagnetic pressure can be as high
as $10^{33}\ \zu{Pa}$! If general relativity's description of pressure as a source of gravitational
fields were wrong, then we would see anomalous effects in the gravitational forces exerted by
heavy elements compared to light ones. Such effects have been searched for both in the
laboratory\footnote{Kreuzer, Phys. Rev. 169 (1968) 1007. Described in section
3.7.3 of Will, ``The Confrontation between General Relativity
and Experiment,'' \url{relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2006-3/}.} and in lunar laser ranging
experiments,\footnote{Bartlett and van Buren, Phys. Rev. Lett. 57 (1986) 21,
also described in Will.} with results that agreed with general relativity's predictions.

<% begin_sec("A perfect fluid",nil,'perfect-fluid') %>
The cloud in example \ref{eg:dust-stress-energy} had a stress-energy tensor
in its own rest frame that was isotropic, i.e., symmetric with respect to the $x$, $y$, and $z$
directions. The tensor became anisotropic when we  switched out of this frame. If a physical system
has a frame in which its stress-energy tensor is isotropic, i.e., of the form
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu}^{\nu}} = \begin{pmatrix}
                   \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & P & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & P & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & P
      \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
we call it a perfect fluid in equilibrium. Although it may contain moving particles, this special frame is
the one in which their momenta cancel out.
In other cases, the pressure need not be isotropic, and the stress
exerted by the fluid need not be perpendicular to the surface on which it acts. The space-space
components of $T$ would then be the classical stress tensor, whose diagonal elements are the anisotropic
pressure, and whose off-diagonal elements are the shear stress. This is the reason for calling $T$
the stress-energy tensor.\index{stress-energy tensor!interpretation of}

The perfect fluid form of the stress-energy tensor is extremely important and common. For example,
cosmologists find that it is a nearly perfect description of the universe on large scales.

We discussed in section \ref{subsec:abstract-index}
the ideas of converting back and forth between vectors and their
corresponding covectors, and of notating this as the raising and lowering indices. We can do the
same thing with the \emph{two} indices of a rank-2 tensor, so that the stress-energy tensor
can be expressed in four different ways: $T^{ab}$, $T_{ab}$, $T\indices{^a_b}$,
and $T\indices{_a^b}$, but the symmetry of $T$ means that there is no interesting
distinction between the final two of these. In special relativity, the
distinctions among the various forms are not especially
fascinating. We can always cover all of spacetime with Minkowski coordinates, so that the form
of the metric is simply a diagonal matrix with elements $\pm1$ on the diagonal. As with a rank-1 tensor, 
raising and lowering indices on a rank-2 tensor just flips some components and leaves others alone.
The methods for raising and lowering don't need to be deduced or memorized, since they follow
uniquely from the grammar of index notation, e.g., $T\indices{^a_b}=g_{bc}T^{ac}$.
But there is the potential for a lot of confusion with all the signs, and in addition
there is the fact that some people use a $+---$ signature while others use $-+++$. Since perfect
fluids are so important, I'll demonstrate how all of this works out in that case.

For a perfect fluid, we can write the stress-energy tensor in the coordinate-independent form
\begin{equation*}
  T^{ab}=(\rho+P)o^a o^b -(o^co_c) Pg^{ab}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where
$\vc{o}$ represents the velocity vector of an observer in the fluid's rest frame,
and $o^co_c=o^2=\vc{o}\cdot\vc{o}$ equals
1 for our $+---$ signature or $-1$ for the signature $-+++$. For ease of writing,
let's abbreviate the signature factor as $s=o^co_c$.

Suppose that the metric is diagonal, but its components are varying, 
$g_{\alpha\beta}=\operatorname{diag}(sA^2,-sB^2,\ldots)$. The properly normalized
velocity vector of an observer at (coordinate-)rest is
$o^\alpha=(A^{-1},0,0,0)$. Lowering the index gives $o_\alpha=(sA,0,0,0)$.
The various forms of the stress-energy tensor then look like the following:
\begin{align*}
  T_{00} = A^2\rho   \quad & \quad T_{11} = B^2 P \\
  T\indices{^0_0} = s\rho   \quad & \quad T\indices{^1_1} = - sP \\
  T^{00} = A^{-2}\rho   \quad & \quad T^{11} = B^{-2} P\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Which of these forms is the ``real'' one, e.g., which form of the $00$ component
is the one that the observer $\vc{o}$
actually measures when she sticks a shovel in the ground, pulls out a certain volume
of dirt, weighs it, and determines $\rho$? The answer is that the index notation is
so slick and well designed that \emph{all} of them are equally ``real,'' and we don't
need to memorize which actually corresponds to measurements. When she does this
measurement with the shovel, she could say that she is measuring the quantity $T^{ab}o_a o_b$.
But because all of the $a$'s and $b$'s are paired off, this expression is a rank-0 tensor.
That means that $T^{ab}o_a o_b$, $T_{ab}o^a o^b$,
and $T\indices{^a_b}o_ao^b$ are all the same number.
If, for example, we have coordinates in which the metric is diagonal and has elements $\pm 1$,
then in all these expressions the differing signs of the $o$'s are exactly compensated for
by the signs of the $T$'s.

\begin{eg}{A rope under tension}\label{eg:gliding-rope}
As a real-world example in which the pressure is \emph{not} isotropic, consider a rope that is
moving inertially but under tension, i.e., equal forces at its ends cancel out so that the rope
doesn't accelerate.
Tension is the same as negative pressure. If the rope lies along the $x$ axis and its fibers are
only capable of supporting tension along that axis, then the rope's stress-energy tensor will be of
the form
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu}^{\nu}} = \begin{pmatrix}
                   \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & P & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0
      \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $P$ is negative and equals minus the tension per unit cross-sectional area.

Conservation of energy-momentum is expressed as (eq.~\ref{eq:stress-energy-div-zero},
p.~\pageref{eq:stress-energy-div-zero})
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial T^{ab}}{\partial x^a} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Converting the abstract indices to concrete ones, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial T^{\mu\nu}}{\partial x^\mu} = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where there is an implied sum over $\mu$, and the equation must hold both in the case where
$\nu$ is a label for $t$ and the one where it refers to $x$.

In the first case, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial T^{tt}}{\partial t} +   \frac{\partial T^{xt}}{\partial x} = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which is a statement of conservation of energy, energy being the timelike component of
the energy-momentum.
The first term is zero because $\rho$ is constant by virtue of our assumption that the rope
was uniform. The second term is zero because $ T^{xt}=0$. Therefore conservation of
energy is satisfied. This came about automatically because by writing down a time-independent
expression for the stress-energy, we were dictating a static equilibrium.

When $\nu$ stands for $x$, we get an equation that requires the $x$ component of momentum to be conserved,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial T^{tx}}{\partial t} +   \frac{\partial T^{xx}}{\partial x} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This simply says
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
meaning that the tension in the rope is constant along its length.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A rope supporting its own weight}\label{eg:loaded-rope}
A variation on example \ref{eg:gliding-rope} is one in which the rope is hanging and supports its
own weight. Although gravity is involved, we can solve this problem without general relativity, by
exploiting the equivalence principle (section \ref{sec:ep}, p.~\pageref{sec:ep}).
As discussed in section \ref{sec:define-inertia} on p.~\pageref{sec:define-inertia}, an inertial
frame in relativity is one that is free-falling.
We define an inertial frame of reference $\vc{o}$, corresponding
to an observer free-falling past the rope, and a noninertial frame $\vc{o}'$ at rest relative to the rope.

Since the rope is hanging in static equilibrium, observer $\vc{o}'$ sees a stress-energy tensor that
has no time-dependence. The off-diagonal components vanish in this frame, since there is no momentum.
The stress-energy tensor is
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu'}^{\nu'}} = \begin{pmatrix}
                   \rho & 0 \\
                   0 & P 
      \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the components involving $y$ and $z$ are zero and not shown,
and $P$ is negative as in example \ref{eg:gliding-rope}.
We could try to apply the conservation of energy condition to this stress-energy tensor as in
example \ref{eg:gliding-rope}, but that would be a mistake. As discussed in 
\ref{sec:xfn-derivatives} on p.~\pageref{sec:xfn-derivatives}, rates of change can \emph{only}
be measured by taking partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates if the coordinates
are Minkowski, i.e., in an inertial frame. Therefore we need to transform this stress-energy
tensor into the inertial frame $\vc{o}$.

For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the Newtonian approximation, so that the change of
coordinates between the two frames is
\begin{align*}
  t & \approx t' \\
  x & \approx x'+\frac{1}{2}at'^2\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where $a>0$ if the free-falling observer falls in the negative $x$ direction, i.e., positive
$x$ is up. That is, if a point on the rope at a fixed $x'$ is marked with a spot of paint, then
free-falling observer $\vc{o}$ sees the spot moving up, to larger values of $x$, at $t>0$.
Applying the tensor transformation law, we find
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu}^{\nu}} = \begin{pmatrix}
                   \rho & \rho a t \\
                   \rho a t & P+\rho a^2t^2 
      \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
As in example \ref{eg:gliding-rope}, conservation of energy is trivially satisfied.
Conservation of momentum gives
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial T^{tx}}{\partial t} +   \frac{\partial T^{xx}}{\partial x} = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
  \rho a + \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Integrating this with respect to $x$, we have
\begin{equation*}
  P = -\rho a x + \text{constant}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Let the cross-sectional area of the rope be $A$, and let $\mu=\rho A$ be the mass per unit length
and $T=-PA$ the tension. We then find
\begin{equation*}
  T = \mu a x + \text{constant}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Conservation of momentum requires that the tension vary along the length of the rope,
just as we expect from Newton's laws: a section of the rope higher up has more
weight below it to support.
\end{eg}
<% end_sec('simple-examples') %>

<% begin_sec("Energy conditions",nil,'energy-conditions') %>
The result of example \ref{eg:loaded-rope} could cause something scary to happen.
If we walk up to a clothesline under tension and give it a quick karate chop, we will
observe wave pulses propagating away from the chop in both directions, at
velocities $v=\pm\sqrt{T/\mu}$. But the result of the example is that this expression
increases without limit as $x$ gets larger and larger. At some point, $v$ will exceed the
speed of light. (Of course any real rope would break
long before this much tension was achieved.) Two things led to the problematic result:
(1) we assumed there was no constraint on the possible stress-energy tensor in the
rest frame of the rope; and (2) we used a Newtonian approximation to change from this
frame to the free-falling frame. In reality, we don't know of any material so stiff that vibrations
propagate in it faster than $c$. In fact, all ordinary materials are made of atoms, atoms are
bound to each other by electromagnetic forces, and therefore no material made of atoms can transmit
vibrations faster than the speed of an electromagnetic wave, $c$.

Based on these conditions, we therefore expect there to be certain constraints on the
stress-energy tensor of any ordinary form of matter. For example, 
we don't expect to find any rope whose stress-energy tensor looks like this:
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu}^{\nu}} = \begin{pmatrix}
                   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & -2 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0
      \end{pmatrix}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
because here the tensile stress $+2$ is greater than the mass density 1, which would
lead to $|v|=\sqrt{2/1}>1$. Constraints of this kind are called energy conditions.
Hypothetical forms of matter that violate them are referred to as exotic matter;
if they exist, they are not made of atoms.
This particular example violates the
an energy condition known as the dominant energy condition, which requires $\rho>0$ and
$|P|>\rho$. There are about five energy conditions that are commonly used, and a detailed
discussion of them is more appropriate for a general relativity text. The common ideas that
recur in many of them are: (1) that energy density is never negative
in any frame of reference, and (2) that there is never a flux of energy propagating at a
speed greater than $c$.

An energy condition that is particularly simple to express 
is the trace energy condition (TEC),\label{tec}
\begin{equation*}
  T\indices{^a_a} \ge 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where we have to have one upper index and one lower index in order to obey the grammatical
rules of index notation.
In Minkowski coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$, this becomes $T\indices{^\mu_\mu}\ge0$, with the
implied sum over $\mu$ expanding to give
\begin{equation*}
  T\indices{^t_t}+T\indices{^x_x}+T\indices{^y_y}+T\indices{^z_z} \ge 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The left-hand side of this relation, the sum of the main-diagonal elements of a matrix, is
called the trace of the matrix, hence the name of this energy condition.
Since this book uses the signature $+---$ for the metric, raising the second index changes this to
\begin{equation*}
  T\indices{^t^t}-T\indices{^x^x}-T\indices{^y^y}-T\indices{^z^z} \ge 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
In example \ref{eg:dust-stress-energy} on p.~\pageref{eg:dust-stress-energy}, we computed the
stress-energy tensor of a cloud of dust, in a frame moving at velocity $v$ relative to the cloud's
rest frame. The result was
\begin{equation*}
T\indices{^{\mu'}^{\nu'}} = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   \gamma^2\rho & \gamma^2 v \rho & 0 & 0 \\
                   \gamma^2 v \rho & \gamma^2 v ^2\rho & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                   0 & 0 & 0 & 0    
      \end{matrix} \right)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
In this example, the trace energy condition is satisfied precisely under the condition
$|v|\le 1$, which can be interpreted as a statement that according the TEC, the mass-energy
of the cloud can never be transported at a speed greater than $c$ in any frame.

<% begin_sec("Gauss's theorem",nil,'gauss') %>\index{Gauss's theorem}
<% begin_sec("Integral conservation laws",nil,'integrated-conservation') %>
We've expressed conservation of charge and energy-momentum in terms of zero divergences,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial J^a}{\partial x^a} & = 0 \\
  \frac{\partial T^{ab}}{\partial x^a} & = 0\eqquad.
\end{align*}
These are expressed in terms of derivatives. The derivative of a function at a certain point
only depends on the behavior of the function near that point, so these are local statements
of conservation. Conservation laws can also be stated globally: the total amount
of something remains constant. Taking charge as an example, observer $\vc{o}$ defines Minkowski
coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$, and at a time $t_1$ says that the total
amount of charge in some region is
\begin{equation*}
  q(t_1) = \int_{t_1} J^a \der S_a\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the subscript $t_1$ means that the integrand is to be evaluated over the surface of
simultaneity $t=t_1$, and $\der S_a=(\der x\der y\der z,0,0,0)$
is an element of 3-volume expressed as a covector (p.~\pageref{three-vol-covector}).
The charge at some later time $t_2$ would be given by a similar integral.
If charge is conserved, and if our region is surrounded by an empty region through which no charge
is coming in or out, then we should have $q(t_2)=q(t_1)$.
<% end_sec('integrated-conservation') %>

<% begin_sec("A simple form of Gauss's theorem",nil,'gauss-simple') %>
The connection between the local and global conservation laws is provided by a theorem
called Gauss's theorem. In your course on electromagnetism, you learned Gauss's law, which
relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge contained inside the surface.
In the case where no charges are present, it says that the flux through such a surface cancels out.
The interpretation is that since field lines only begin or end on charges, the absence of any
charges means that the lines can't begin or end, and therefore, as in
figure \figref{gauss-fluxes-cancel}, any field line that enters the
surface (contributing some negative flux) must eventually come back out (creating some positive
flux that cancels out the negative). But there is nothing about figure \figref{gauss-fluxes-cancel}
that requires it to be interpreted as a drawing of electric field lines. It could just as easily
be a drawing of the world-lines of some charged particles in $1+1$ dimensions. The bottom of the
rectangle would then be the surface at $t_1$ and the top $t_2$. We have $q(t_1)=3$ and
$q(t_2)=3$ as well.

  fig(
    'gauss-fluxes-cancel',
    %q{Three lines go in, and three come out. These could be field lines or world lines.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

For simplicity, let's start with a very restricted version of Gauss's theorem.
Let a vector field $J^a$ be defined in two dimensions.
(We don't care whether
the two dimensions are both spacelike or one spacelike and one timelike; that is, Gauss's
theorem doesn't depend on the signature of the metric.) Let R be a rectangular area,
and let S be its boundary. Define the flux of the field through S as
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi = \int_\text{S} J^a \der S_a\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the integral is to be taken over all four sides, and the covector $\der S_a$ points outward.
If the field has zero divergence, $\partial J^a/\partial x^a=0$, then
the flux is zero.

Proof: Define coordinates $x$ and $y$ aligned with the rectangle. Along the top of the
rectangle, the element of the surface, oriented outwards, is $\der\vc{S}=(0,\der x)$, so the
contribution to the flux from the top is
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi_\text{top} = \int_\text{top} J^y(y_\text{top}) \der x\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
At the bottom, an outward orientation gives $\der\vc{S}=(0,-\der x)$, so
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi_\text{bottom} = -\int_\text{bottom} J^y(y_\text{bottom}) \der x\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, the sum of these is
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi_\text{top}+\Phi_\text{bottom}
         = \int_\text{R} \frac{\partial J^y}{\partial y} \der y \der x\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Adding in the similar expressions for the left and right, we get
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi = \int_\text{R} \left( \frac{\partial J^x}{\partial x}
                      +\frac{\partial J^y}{\partial y}\right) \der x \der y\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
But the integrand is the divergence, which is zero by assumption, so $\Phi=0$ as claimed.
<% end_sec('gauss-simple') %>

<% begin_sec("The general form of Gauss's theorem",nil,'gauss-general') %>
Although the coordinates were labeled $x$ and $y$, the proof made no use of the metric,
so the result is equally valid regardless of the signature. The rectangle could equally
well have been a rectangle in $1+1$-dimensional spacetime. The generalization to $n$
dimensions is also automatic, and everything also carries through without modification
if we replace the vector $J^a$ with a tensor such as $T^{ab}$ that has more indices --- the
extra index $b$ just comes along for the ride. Sometimes, as with Gauss's law in electromagnetism,
we are interested in fields whose divergences are not zero. Gauss's theorem then becomes
\begin{equation*}
  \int_\text{S} J^a \der S_a = \int_\text{R} \frac{\partial J^a}{\partial x^a} \der v\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $\der v$ is the element of $n$-volume. In $3+1$ dimensions we could use Minkowski coordinates
to write the element of 4-volume as
$\der v=\der t \der x \der y \der z$, and even though this expression in written
in terms of these specific coordinates, it is actually Lorentz invariant
(section \ref{sec:area-is-scalar}, p.~\pageref{sec:area-is-scalar}).

The generalization to a region R with an arbitrary shape, figure \figref{gauss-proof}, is less trivial.
The basic idea is to break up the region into rectanglular boxes, 
\subfigref{gauss-proof}{1}. Where the faces of two boxes coincide on the interior of R,
their own outward directions are opposite. Therefore if we add up the fluxes through the surfaces
of all the boxes, the contributions on the interior cancel, and we're left with only the exterior
contributions. If R could be dissected exactly into boxes, then this would complete the proof,
since the sum of exterior contributions would be the same as the flux through S, and the left-hand
side of Gauss's theorem would be additive over the boxes, as is the right-hand side.
<% marg(100) %>
<%
  fig(
    'gauss-proof',
    %q{Proof of Gauss's theorem for a region with an arbitrary shape.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The difficulty arises because
a smooth shape typically cannot be built out of bricks, a fact that is well known to Lego enthusiasts who
build elaborate models of the Death Star.
We could argue on physical grounds that no real-world measurement of the flux can
depend on the granular structure of S at arbitrarily small scales, but this feels a little unsatisfying.
For comparison, it is \emph{not} strictly true that surface areas can be treated in this way.
For example, if we approximate a unit 3-sphere using smaller and smaller boxes, the limit of the
surface area is $6\pi$, which is quite a bit greater than the surface area $4\pi/3$ of the limiting surface.

Instead, we explicitly consider the nonrectangular pieces at the surface, such as the one in
\subfigref{gauss-proof}{2}. In this drawing in $n=2$ dimensions, the top of this
piece is approximately a line,
and in the limit we'll be considering, where its width becomes an infinitesimally small $\der x$,
the error incurred by approximating it as a line will be negligible.
We define vectors $\der\vc{x}$ and $\der\vc{x}^*$ as shown in the figure. 
In more than the two dimensions shown in the figure, we would approximate the top surface as
an $(n-1)$-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by vectors $\der\vc{x}^*$, $\der\vc{y}^*$, \ldots
This is the point
at which the use of the covector $S_a$ (p.~\pageref{three-vol-covector}) pays off by
greatly simplifying the 
proof.\label{covector-used-in-gauss-proof}\footnote{
Here is an example of the ugly complications that occur if one doesn't have access to
this piece of technology. In the low-tech approach, in Euclidean space, one defines an element of surface
area $\der\vc{A}=\hat{\vc{n}}\der A$, where the unit vector $\hat{\vc{n}}$ is outward-directed
with $\hat{\vc{n}}\cdot\hat{\vc{n}}=1$. But in a signature such as $+---$, we could have a region R such
that over some large area of the bounding surface S, the normal direction was lightlike.
It would therefore be impossible to scale $\hat{\vc{n}}$ so that $\hat{\vc{n}}\cdot\hat{\vc{n}}$
was anything but zero. As an example of how much work it is to resolve such issues using
stone-age tools, see Synge, Relativity: The Special Theory, VIII, \S 6-7, where the complete
argument takes up 22 pages.}
Applying this to the top of the triangle, $\der\vc{S}$ is defined 
as the linear function that takes a vector $\vc{J}$ and gives the $n$-volume spanned by
$\vc{J}$ along with $\der\vc{x}^*$, \ldots 

Call the vertical coordinate on the diagram $t$,
and consider the contribution to the flux from $\vc{J}$'s time component,
$J^t$. Because the triangle's size is
an infinitesimal of order $\der x$, we can approximate $J^t$ as being a constant throughout
the triangle, while incurring only an error of order $\der x$. (By stating Gauss's theorem
in terms of derivatives of $\vc{J}$, we implicitly assumed it to be differentiable,
so it is not possible for it to jump discontinuously.)
Since $\der\vc{S}$ depends linearly not
just on $\vc{J}$ but on all the vectors, the difference between the flux at the top and bottom
of the triangle equals is proportional to the area spanned by $\vc{J}$ and
$\der \vc{x}^*-\der \vc{x}$. But the latter vector is
is in the $t$ direction, and therefore the area it spans when taken with $J^t$ is approximately zero.
Therefore the contribution of $J^t$ to the flux through the triangle is zero.
To estimate the possible error due to the approximations, we have to count powers of $\der x$.
The possible variation of $J^t$ over the triangle is of order $(\der x)^1$. The covector
$\der\vc{S}$ is of order $(\der x)^{n-1}$, so the possible error in the flux is of order
$(\der x)^n$.

This was only an estimate of one part of the flux, the part contributed by the component $J^t$. However,
we get the same estimate for the other parts. For example, if we refer to the two dimensions
in figure \subfigref{gauss-proof}{2} as $t$ and $x$, then
interchanging the roles of $t$ and $x$ in the above argument produces the same error estimate
for the contribution from $J^x$.

This is good. When we began this argument, we were motivated to be
cautious by our observation
that a quantity such as the surface area of R can't
be calculated as the limit of the surface area as approximated using boxes. The reason we have
that problem for surface area is that the error in the approximation on a small patch is of order 
$(\der x)^{n-1}$, which is an infinitesimal of the same order as the surface area of the patch itself.
Therefore when we scale down the boxes, the error doesn't get small compared to the total area.
But when we consider flux, the error contibuted by each of the irregularly shaped pieces near the surface
goes like $(\der x)^n$, which is of the order
of the $n$-volume of the piece. This volume goes to zero in
the limit where the boxes get small, and therefore the error goes to zero as well. This establishes
the generalization of Gauss's theorem to a region R of arbitrary shape.

<% begin_sec("The energy-momentum vector",nil,'p-vector') %>
Einstein's celebrated $E=mc^2$ is a special case of the statement that energy-momentum is conserved,
transforms like a four-vector, and has a norm $m$ equal to the rest mass. Section
\ref{sec:internal-structure} on p.~\pageref{sec:internal-structure} explored some of the problems
with Einstein's original attempt at a proof of this statement, but only now are we prepared to
completely resolve them. One of the problems was the definitional one of what we mean by the
energy-momentum of a system that is not composed of pointlike particles. The answer is that for
any phenomenon that carries energy-momentum, we must decide how it contributes to the stress-energy tensor.
For example, the stress-energy tensor of the electric and magnetic fields is described in
section \ref{sec:em-stress-energy} on p.~\pageref{sec:em-stress-energy}.

For the reasons discussed in section \ref{sec:internal-structure} on p.~\pageref{sec:internal-structure},
it is necessary to assume that energy-momentum is locally conserved, and also that the system being
described is isolated. Local conservation is described by the zero-divergence property of the stress-energy
tensor, $\partial T^{ab}/\partial x^a=0$. Once we assume local conservation, figure
\figref{p-conservation} shows how to prove conservation of the integrated energy-momentum vector using
Gauss's theorem. Fix a frame of reference $\vc{o}$.
Surrounding the system, shown as a dark stream flowing through spacetime, we draw a box.
The box is bounded on its past
side by a surface that $\vc{o}$ considers to be a surface of simultaneity $\text{s}_\text{A}$,
and likewise on the future side $\text{s}_\text{B}$.
It doesn't actually matter if the sides of the box are straight or curved according to $\vc{o}$. What does
matter is that because the system is isolated, we have enough room so that between the system and the 
sides of the box there can be a region of vacuum, in which the stress-energy tensor vanishes.
<% marg(30) %>
<%
  fig(
    'p-conservation',
    %q{Conservation of the integrated energy-momentum vector.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Observer $\vc{o}$ says that at the initial
time corresponding to $\text{s}_\text{A}$, the total amount of energy-momentum in
the system was
\begin{equation*}
  p_A^\mu = - \int_{\text{s}_\text{A}} T^{\mu\nu} \der S_\nu\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the minus sign occurs because we take $\der S_\nu$ to point outward, for compatibility with
Gauss's theorem, and this makes it antiparallel to the velocity vector $\vc{o}$, which is
the opposite of the orientation defined in equations \eqref{eqn:stress-energy-measurements}
on p.~\pageref{eqn:stress-energy-measurements}. At the final time we have
\begin{equation*}
  p_B^\mu =  \int_{\text{s}_\text{B}} T^{\mu\nu} \der S_\nu\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
with a plus sign because the outward direction is now the same as the direction of $\vc{o}$.
Because of the vacuum region, there is no flux through the sides of the box, and therefore by

We also need to show that the integrated energy-momentum transforms properly as a four-vector.
To prove this, we apply Gauss's theorem to the region shown in figure \figref{p-transformation},
where $\text{s}_\text{C}$ is a surface of simultaneity according to some other observer $\vc{o}'$.
Gauss's theorem tells us that $\vc{p}_\text{B}=\vc{p}_\text{C}$, which means that the energy-momentum
on the two surfaces is the \emph{same} vector in the absolute sense --- but this doesn't mean that the two
vectors have the same \emph{components} as measured by different observers. Observer $\vc{o}$
says that $\text{s}_\text{B}$ is a surface of simultaneity, and therefore considers
$\vc{p}_\text{B}$ to be the total energy-momentum at a certain time. She says the total mass-energy
is $p_B^\mu o_\mu$ (eq.~\eqref{eqn:stress-energy-e-meas}, p.~\pageref{eqn:stress-energy-e-meas}),
and similarly for the total momentum in the three spatial directions $\vc{s}_1$, $\vc{s}_2$, and $\vc{s}_3$
(eq.~\eqref{eqn:stress-energy-p-meas}). Observer $\vc{o}'$, meanwhile, considers
$\text{s}_\text{C}$ to be a surface of simultaneity, and has the same interpretations for
quantities such as $p_C^\mu o'_\mu$. But this is just a way of saying that $\vc{p}_B^\mu$ and
$\vc{p}_C^\mu$ are related to each other by a change of basis
from $(\vc{o},\vc{s}_1,\vc{s}_2,\vc{s}_3)$ to $(\vc{o}',\vc{s}'_1,\vc{s}'_2,\vc{s}'_3)$.
A change of basis like this is just what we mean by a Lorentz transformation,
so the integrated energy-momentum $\vc{p}$ transforms as a four-vector.

<% begin_sec("Angular momentum",nil,'cons-ang-mom') %>\index{angular momentum!conservation of}
In sec.~\ref{subsec:l-tensor}, p.~\pageref{subsec:l-tensor}, we gave physical and mathematical
plausibility arguments for defining relativistic angular momentum as $L^{ab}=r^a p^b - r^b p^a$.
We can now show that this quantity is actually conserved. Just as the flux of energy-momentum $p^a$
is the stress-energy tensor $T^{ab}$, we can take the angular momentum $L^{ab}$ and
define its flux $\lambda^{abc}=r^aT^{bc}-r^bT^{ac}$. An observer with velocity vector $o^c$
says that the density of energy-momentum is
$T^{ac}o_c$ and the density of angular momentum is $\lambda^{abc}o_c$. If we can show that the
divergence of $\lambda$ with respect to its third index is zero,
then it follows that angular momentum is conserved. The divergence is
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial \lambda^{abc}}{\partial x^c} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^c}\left(r^aT^{bc}-r^bT^{ac}\right).
\end{equation*}
The product rule gives
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial \lambda^{abc}}{\partial x^c} = \delta^a_cT^{bc}+r^a\frac{\partial}{\partial x^c}T^{bc}
                -\delta^b_cT^{ac}-r^b\frac{\partial}{\partial x^c}T^{ac},
\end{equation*}
where $\delta^i_j$, called the Kronecker delta, is defined as 1 if $i=j$ and 0 if $i\ne j$.
The divergence of the stress-energy tensor is zero, so the second and fourth terms vanish,
and
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial \lambda^{abc}}{\partial x^c} &= \delta^a_cT^{bc} -\delta^b_cT^{ac} \\
                                              &= T^{ba}-T^{ab},
\end{align*}
but this is zero because the stress-energy tensor is symmetric.

<% begin_sec("The covariant derivative",nil,'covariant-derivative',{'optional'=>true}) %>\index{covariant derivative}\index{derivative!covariant}\index{covariant derivative!in relativity}\index{derivative!covariant!in relativity}

In this optional section we deal with the issues raised in section \ref{sec:xfn-derivatives}
on p.~\pageref{sec:xfn-derivatives}. 
We noted there that in non-Minkowski coordinates, one
cannot naively use changes in the components of a vector as a measure of a change in the vector
itself. A constant
\emph{scalar} function remains constant when expressed in a new coordinate system, but the same is not
true for a constant vector function, or for any tensor of higher rank. This is because the change
of coordinates changes the units in which the vector is measured, and if the change of coordinates
is nonlinear, the units vary from point to point. This topic doesn't logically belong in this chapter,
but I've placed it here because it can't be discussed clearly without already having covered
tensors of rank higher than one.

Consider the one-dimensional case, in which a
vector $v^a$ has only one component, and the metric is also a single number, so that we can omit the
indices and simply write $v$ and $g$. (We just have to remember that $v$ is really a vector,
even though we're leaving out the upper index.)
If $v$ is constant, its derivative $\der v/\der x$, computed in the ordinary way without any correction term, is zero.
If we further assume that the metric is simply the constant $g=1$, then zero is
not just the answer but the right answer.

Now suppose we transform into a new coordinate system $X$, and
the metric $G$, expressed in this coordinate system, is not constant.
Applying the tensor
transformation law, we have $V =  v \der X/\der x$, and differentiation
with respect to $X$ will not give zero, because the factor $\der X/\der x$ isn't constant. This is the wrong answer:
$V$ isn't really varying, it just appears to vary because $G$ does.
<% marg(300) %>
<%
  fig(
    'varying-ruler-spacing',
    %q{These three rulers represent three choices of coordinates.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

We want to add a correction term onto the derivative operator $\der/\der X$, forming a
new derivative operator $\nabla_X$
that gives the right answer. $\nabla_X$ is called the covariant derivative. This correction term is easy
to find if we consider what the result ought to be when differentiating the metric itself.
In general, if a tensor appears to vary, it could vary either because it really does vary
or because the metric varies. If the metric \emph{itself} varies, it could be either because
the metric really does vary or \ldots because the metric varies. In other words, there is
no sensible way to assign a nonzero covariant derivative to the metric itself, so we must have
$\nabla_X G=0$. The required correction therefore consists of replacing $\der/\der X$ with
\begin{equation*}
 \nabla_X=\frac{\der}{\der X}-G^{-1}\frac{\der G}{\der X}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Applying this to $G$ gives zero.
$G$ is a second-rank tensor with two lower indices. If we apply the same correction to the derivatives
of other tensors of this type, we will get nonzero results, and they will be the right
nonzero results. 

Mathematically, the form of the derivative is $(1/y)\der y/\der x$, which is known as a logarithmic derivative,
since it equals $\der(\ln y)/\der x$. It measures the \emph{multiplicative} rate of change of $y$. For example,
if $y$ scales up by a factor of $k$ when $x$ increases by 1 unit, then the logarithmic derivative of $y$ is
$\ln k$. The logarithmic derivative of $e^{cx}$ is $c$. The logarithmic nature of the correction term to 
$\nabla_X$ is a good thing, because it lets us take changes of scale, which are multiplicative changes, and
convert them to additive corrections to the derivative operator. The additivity of the corrections is
necessary if the result of a covariant derivative is to be a tensor, since tensors are additive creatures.

What about quantities that are not second-rank covariant tensors? Under a rescaling of 
coordinates by a factor of $k$,
covectors scale by $k^{-1}$, and second-rank tensors with two lower indices scale by $k^{-2}$. The
correction term should therefore be half as much for covectors,
\begin{equation*}
 \nabla_X=\frac{\der}{\der X}-\frac{1}{2}G^{-1}\frac{\der G}{\der X}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
and
should have an opposite sign for vectors.

Generalizing the correction term to derivatives of vectors in more than one dimension, we should have something of this form:
\begin{align*}
  \nabla_a v^b &= \partial_a v^b + \Gamma\indices{^b_{ac}}v^c\\
  \nabla_a v_b &= \partial_a v_b - \Gamma\indices{^c_{ba}}v_c\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where $\Gamma\indices{^b_{ac}}$, called the Christoffel symbol,\index{Christoffel symbol}
does not transform like a tensor, and involves derivatives of the metric.
(``Christoffel'' is pronounced ``Krist-AWful,'' with the accent on the middle syllable.)

An important gotcha is that when we evaluate a particular component of a covariant
derivative such as $\nabla_2 v^3$, it is possible for the result to be nonzero
even if the component $v^3$ vanishes identically.

\begin{eg}{Christoffel symbols on the globe}\label{eg:christoffel-on-globe}
As a qualitative example, consider the airplane trajectory shown in figure \figref{christoffel-on-globe},
from London to Mexico City.
This trajectory is the shortest one between these two points; such a minimum-length trajectory
is called a geodesic.\index{geodesic}
In physics it is customary to work with the colatitude, $\theta$, measured down from
the north pole, rather then the latitude, measured from the equator.
At P, over the North Atlantic, the plane's colatitude has a minimum. 
(We can see, without having to take it on faith from the figure, that such a minimum must occur.
The easiest way to convince oneself of this is to consider a path that goes directly over the pole,
at $\theta=0$.)
<% marg(20) %>
<%
  fig(
    'christoffel-on-globe',
    %q{Example \ref{eg:christoffel-on-globe}.}

%>
<% end_marg %>

At P, the plane's
velocity vector points directly west. At Q, over New England, its velocity has a large component to the
south. Since the path is a geodesic and the plane has constant speed, the velocity vector is simply being
parallel-transported; the vector's covariant derivative is zero. Since we have $v_\theta=0$ at P,
the only way to explain the nonzero and positive value of $\partial_\phi v^\theta$ is
that we have a nonzero and negative value of $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$.

By symmetry, we can infer that $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ must have a positive value in
the southern hemisphere, and must vanish at the equator. 

$\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ is computed in example \ref{eg:christoffel-on-globe-quantitative}
on page \pageref{eg:christoffel-on-globe-quantitative}.

Symmetry also requires that this Christoffel symbol be independent of $\phi$, and
it must also be independent of the radius of the sphere.
\end{eg}

To compute the covariant derivative of a higher-rank tensor, we just add more correction terms, e.g.,
\begin{align*}
  \nabla_a U_{bc} = \partial_a U_{bc} - \Gamma\indices{^d_{ba}}U_{dc}-\Gamma\indices{^d_{ca}}U_{bd} \\
\intertext{or}
  \nabla_a U_b^c = \partial_a U_b^c - \Gamma\indices{^d_{ba}}U_d^c+\Gamma\indices{^c_{ad}}U_b^d\eqquad.
\end{align*}

With the partial derivative $\partial_\mu$, it does not make sense to use the metric to raise the index
and form $\partial^\mu$. It \emph{does} make sense to do so with covariant derivatives, so $\nabla^a = g^{ab} \nabla_b$
is a correct identity.

<% begin_sec("Comma, semicolon, and birdtracks notation",nil,'covariant-derivative-notation') %>
Some authors use superscripts with commas and semicolons to indicate partial and covariant derivatives. The following
equations give equivalent notations for the same derivatives:
\begin{align*}
  \partial_\mu &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}\\
  \partial_\mu X_\nu &= X_{\nu,\mu} \\
  \nabla_a   X_b &= X_{b;a} \\
  \nabla^a   X_b &= X\indices{_b^{;a}} 
\end{align*}
Figure \figref{nabla-birdtracks} shows two examples of the corresponding
birdtracks notation. Because birdtracks are meant to be manifestly coordinate-independent, they
do not have a way of expressing non-covariant derivatives.

<% begin_sec("Finding the Christoffel symbol from the metric",nil,'christoffel-from-metric') %>
We've already found the Christoffel symbol in terms of the metric in one dimension. Expressing it in
tensor notation, we have
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma\indices{^d_{ba}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\left(\partial_? g_{??}\right)\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where inversion of the one-component matrix $G$ has been replaced by matrix inversion, and,
more importantly, the question marks indicate that there would be more than one way to place
the subscripts so that the result would be a grammatical tensor equation. The most general form
for the Christoffel symbol would be 
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma\indices{^b_{ac}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{db}\left(L \partial_c g_{ab}+ M \partial_a g_{cb} + N \partial_b g_{ca}\right)\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where $L$, $M$, and $N$ are constants. Consistency with the one-dimensional expression requires $L+M+N=1$.
The condition $L=M$ arises on physical, not mathematical grounds; it reflects the fact that experiments
have not shown evidence for an effect called torsion,\index{torsion} in which vectors would rotate
in a certain way when transported. The $L$ and $M$ terms have a different
physical significance than the $N$ term.

Suppose an observer uses coordinates such that all objects are described as lengthening over time, and
the change of scale accumulated over one day is a factor of $k>1$.
This is described by the derivative $\partial_t g_{xx}<1$, which affects the $M$ term.
Since the metric is used to calculate squared distances, the
$g_{xx}$ matrix element scales down by $1/\sqrt{k}$. To compensate for
$\partial_t v^x<0$, so we need to add a
positive correction term, $M>0$, to the covariant derivative.
When the same observer measures the rate of change of a vector $v^t$ with \emph{respect} to space,
the rate of change comes out to be too \emph{small}, because the variable she differentiates with
respect to is too big. This requires $N<0$, and the correction is of the same size as the $M$
correction, so $|M|=|N|$. We find $L=M=-N=1$.

Self-check: Does the above argument depend on the use of space for one coordinate and time for the other?

The resulting general expression for the Christoffel symbol in terms of the metric is
\begin{equation*}
  \Gamma\indices{^c_{ab}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\left(\partial_a g_{bd}+\partial_b g_{ad}-\partial_d g_{ab}\right)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
One can go back and check that this gives $\nabla_c g_{ab}=0$.

Self-check: In the case of 1 dimension, show that this reduces to
the earlier result of $-(1/2)\der G/\der X$.

$\Gamma$ is not a tensor, i.e., it doesn't transform according to the tensor transformation rules.
Since $\Gamma$ isn't a tensor, it isn't
obvious that the covariant derivative, which is constructed from it, \emph{is} tensorial.
But if it isn't obvious, neither is it surprising --
the goal of the above derivation was to get results that would be coordinate-independent.

\begin{eg}{Christoffel symbols on the globe, quantitatively}\label{eg:christoffel-on-globe-quantitative}
In example \ref{eg:christoffel-on-globe} on page \pageref{eg:christoffel-on-globe}, we inferred the following
properties for the Christoffel symbol $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ on a sphere of radius $R$: $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$
is independent of $\phi$ and $R$, $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}<0$ in the northern
hemisphere (colatitude $\theta$ less than $\pi/2$), $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}=0$ on the equator,
and $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}>0$ in the southern hemisphere.

The metric on a sphere is $\der s^2=R^2\der\theta^2+R^2\sin^2\theta\der\phi^2$.
The only nonvanishing term in the expression for $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ is the one
involving $\partial_\theta g_{\phi\phi}=2R^2\sin\theta\cos\theta$. The result is
$\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}=-\sin\theta\cos\theta$, which can be verified to have the
properties claimed above.

<% begin_sec("The geodesic equation",nil,'geodesic-equation') %>\label{sec:geodesic-equation}
A world-line is a timelike curve in spacetime. As a special case, some such curves are actually
not curved but straight. Physically, the ones we consider straight are those that could be
the world-line of a test particle not acted on by any non-gravitational forces
(sec.~\ref{sec:define-inertia}, p.~\pageref{sec:define-inertia}).
Mathematically, we will show
in this section how the Christoffel symbols can be used to
find differential equations that describe such motion.
The world-line of a test particle is called a geodesic.\index{geodesic}
The equations also have solutions that are spacelike or lightlike, and we consider these
to be geodesics as well.

Geodesics play the same role in relativity that straight lines play in Euclidean geometry.
In Euclidean geometry, we can specify two points and ask for the curve connecting them that has
minimal length. The answer is a line. 
In special relativity, a timelike geodesic \emph{maximizes} the 
proper time (cf.~section \ref{subsec:maximal-time}, p.~\pageref{subsec:maximal-time}) between two events.

In special relativity, geodesics are given by linear equations when expressed 
in Minkowski coordinates, and the velocity vector of a test particle has constant components
when expressed in Minkowski coordinates. In general relativity, Minkowski coordinates don't exist, and
geodesics don't have the properties we expect based on Euclidean intuition; for example, initially
parallel geodesics may later converge or diverge.\index{geodesic!differential equation for}

<% begin_sec("Characterization of the geodesic",nil,'characterization-of-geodesic') %>
A geodesic can be defined as a world-line that preserves tangency under parallel transport, \figref{geodesic-parallel-transports-tangent}. This is
essentially a mathematical way of expressing the notion that we have previously expressed more informally in terms of ``staying on course'' or
moving ``inertially.'' (For reasons discussed in more detail on p.~\pageref{subsubsec:geodesic-not-extremum},
this definition is preferable to defining a geodesic as a curve of extremal or stationary metric length.)

A curve can be specified by giving functions $x^i(\lambda)$ for its coordinates, where $\lambda$ is a real parameter. A vector lying tangent to the
curve can then be calculated using partial derivatives, $T^i=\partial x^i/\partial\lambda$. There are three ways in which a vector
function of $\lambda$ could change: (1) it could change for the trivial reason that the metric is changing, so that its components
changed when expressed in the new metric; (2) it could change its components perpendicular to the curve; or (3) it could change its
component parallel to the curve. Possibility 1 should not really be considered a change at all, and the definition of the covariant
derivative is specifically designed to be insensitive to this kind of thing. 2 cannot apply to $T^i$, which is tangent by construction.
It would therefore be convenient if $T^i$ happened to
be always the same length. If so, then 3 would not happen either, and
we could reexpress the definition of a geodesic by saying that the covariant derivative of
$T^i$ was zero. For this reason, we will assume for the remainder of this section that the parametrization of the curve has
this property. In a Newtonian context, we could imagine the $x^i$ to be purely spatial coordinates, and $\lambda$ to be
a universal time coordinate. We would then interpret $T^i$ as the velocity, and the restriction would be to a parametrization
describing motion with constant speed. In relativity, the restriction is that $\lambda$ must be an 
affine parameter.
For example, it could be the proper time of a particle, if the curve in question is timelike.

<% begin_sec("Covariant derivative with respect to a parameter",nil,'covar-der-wrt-param') %>
The notation of section \ref{sec:covariant-derivative} is not quite adapted to our present purposes, since it allows us to
express a covariant derivative with respect to one of the coordinates, but not with respect to a parameter such as $\lambda$.
We would like to notate the covariant derivative of $T^i$ with respect to $\lambda$ as $\nabla_\lambda T^i$, even though
$\lambda$ isn't a coordinate.
To connect the two types of derivatives, we can use a total derivative. To make the idea clear, here is how we calculate a total derivative
for a scalar function $f(x,y)$, without tensor notation:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der f}{\der \lambda} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This is just the generalization of the chain rule to a function of two variables. For example, if $\lambda$ represents time and $f$ temperature,
then this would tell us the rate of change of the temperature as a thermometer was carried through space. Applying this to
the present problem, we express the total covariant derivative as
\begin{align*}
  \nabla_\lambda T^i &= (\nabla_b T^i) \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda} \\
                     &= \left(\partial_b T^i + \Gamma\indices{^i_{bc}}T^c\right) \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda}\eqquad.

<% end_sec('covar-der-wrt-param') %> % Covariant derivative with respect to a parameter

<% begin_sec("The geodesic equation",nil,'geodesic-equation') %>\label{geodesic-diffeq}\index{geodesic equation}
Recognizing $\partial_b T^i \der x^b/\der\lambda$ as a total non-covariant derivative, we find
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla_\lambda T^i = \frac{\der T^i}{\der\lambda} + \Gamma\indices{^i_{bc}}T^c \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Substituting $\partial x^i/\partial\lambda$ for $T^i$, and setting the covariant derivative equal to zero, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der^2 x^i}{\der\lambda^2} + \Gamma\indices{^i_{bc}} \frac{\der x^c}{\der\lambda} \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda} = 0 .
\end{equation*}
This is known as the geodesic equation.

If this differential equation is satisfied for one affine
parameter $\lambda$, then it is also satisfied for any other affine parameter $\lambda'=a\lambda+b$, where $a$ and $b$
are constants (problem \ref{hw:geodesic-affine}, p.~\pageref{hw:geodesic-affine}).
Recall that affine parameters are only defined along geodesics, not along arbitrary curves. We can't start by defining
an affine parameter and then use it to find geodesics using this equation, because we can't define an affine parameter
without \emph{first} specifying a geodesic. Likewise, we can't do the geodesic first and then the affine parameter, because
if we already had a geodesic in hand, we wouldn't need the differential equation in order to find a geodesic. The solution
to this chicken-and-egg conundrum is to write down the differential equations and try to find a solution, without trying to specify either
the affine parameter or the geodesic in advance.
<% end_sec('geodesic-equation') %> % The geodesic equation

The geodesic equation is useful in establishing one of
the necessary theoretical foundations of relativity, which is the
uniqueness of geodesics for a given set
of initial conditions. 
If the geodesic were not uniquely determined, then particles
would have no way of deciding how to move. The form of the
geodesic equation guarantees uniqueness, because one can use it to define an algorithm
that constructs a geodesic for a given set of initial conditions.

<% begin_sec("Not characterizable as curves of stationary length",nil,'geodesic-not-extremum') %>

The geodesic equation may seem cumbersome. Why not just define a
geodesic as a curve connecting two points that maximizes or minimizes
its own metric length? The trouble is that this doesn't generalize
nicely to curves that are not timelike. The casual reader may wish to skip
the remainder of this subsection, which discusses this point.

For the spacelike case, we would want to define the proper metric
length $\sigma$ of a curve as $\sigma=\int \sqrt{-g_{ij}dx^i dx^j}$, the
minus sign being necessary because we are using a metric with
signature $+---$, and we want the result to be real. The quantity
$\sigma$ can be thought of as the result we would get by approximating
the curve with a chain of short line segments, and adding their proper
lengths. In the case where the whole curve lies within a plane of
simultaneity for some observer, $\sigma$ is the curve's Euclidean length as
measured by that observer. Our $\sigma$ is neither a maximum nor a minimum for a spacelike geodesic
connecting two events.
To see this, pick a frame in which the
two events are simultaneous, and adopt Minkowski coordinates such that the points both lie on the $x$ axis. Deforming the
geodesic in the $xy$ plane does what we expect according to Euclidean
geometry: it increases the length. Deforming it in the $xt$
plane, however, reduces the length (as becomes obvious when you
consider the case of a large deformation that turns the geodesic into
a curve of length zero, consisting of two lightlike line segments). 
The result is that the geodesic is neither a minimizer nor a maximizer of $\sigma$.

Maximizing or minimizing the proper length is a strong requirement. A related
but more permissive criterion to apply to a curve connecting two fixed points
is that if we vary the curve by some small amount, the variation in length should
vanish to first order. For example, two points A and B on the surface of the earth determine
a great circle, i.e., a circle whose circumference equals that of the earth.
This great circle gives us two different paths by which we could travel from A to B.
One of these will usually be longer than the other. Both of these are as straight as
they can be while keeping to the surface of the earth, so in this context of spherical
geometry they are both considered to be geodesics. One thing that the two paths have
in common is that they are both \emph{stationary}. Stationarity is defined as follows.
Given a certain parametrized curve $\gamma(t)$, let us fix some 
vector $\vc{h}(t)$ at each point on the curve that is tangent to the earth's surface,
and let $\vc{h}$ be a continuous function of $t$ that vanishes at the end-points.
Then if $\epsilon$ is small compared to the radius of the earth, we can clearly
define what it means to perturb $\gamma$ by $\epsilon\vc{h}$, producing another
curve $\gamma^*$ similar to, but not the same as, $\gamma$. Stationarity means
that the difference in length between $\gamma$ and $\gamma^*$ is of order $\epsilon^2$
for small $\epsilon$. This is a generalization of the elementary calculus notion that
a function has a zero derivative near an extremum or point of inflection. In our example on the surface of the
earth, the two geodesics connecting A and B are both stationary.

Spacelike geodesics in special relativity are stationary by the above definition.
However, this assertion may be misleading. Because we construct the displacement
as the product $\epsilon\vc{h}$, its \emph{derivative} is also guaranteed to shrink
in proportion to $\epsilon$ for small $\epsilon$. We could loosen this requirement a little bit, and
only require that the magnitude of the displacement be of order $\epsilon$. In this case,
one can show that spacelike curves are not stationary. For example, any spacelike curve
can be approximated to an arbitrary degree of precision by a chain of lightlike geodesic
segments. Thus an arbitrarily small perturbation in the curve reduces its length to zero.

The situation becomes even worse for lightlike
geodesics.  Here we would have to define what ``length'' was. We could
either take an absolute value, $L=\int \sqrt{|g_{ij}dx^i dx^j|}$, or
not, $L=\int \sqrt{g_{ij}dx^i dx^j}$. If we don't take the absolute
value, $L$ need not be real for small variations of the geodesic, and
therefore we don't have a well-defined ordering, and can't say whether
$L$ is a maximum, a minimum, or neither. Regardless of whether we take
the absolute value, we have $L=0$ for a lightlike geodesic, but
the square root function doesn't have differentiable behavior when its argument
is zero, so we don't have stationarity.  If we do take the absolute value, then for the geodesic
curve, the length is zero, which is the shortest possible. However,
one can have nongeodesic curves of zero length, such as a lightlike
helical curve about the $t$ axis.

This chapter has focused on fluxes of conserved quantities; we wanted to rule out
pictures like \subfigref{congruence-vs-conservation}{1}, in which the appearance and disappearance
of world-lines would imply nonconservation of properties such as charge and mass-energy.
But the mathematical techniques we've developed turn out to be an elegant way to approach
the different issues described in the other parts of figure \figref{congruence-vs-conservation}.

In \subfigref{congruence-vs-conservation}{2}, we have \emph{expansion}. For example, the world-lines could
represent galaxies getting farther apart because of cosmological expansion resulting from the Big Bang.
We do \emph{not} expect rulers to expand or contract, in the sense that although a ruler may exhibit
Lorentz contraction, it should always have the same length in its own rest frame unless it has been
mechanically stressed or altered.

If there is more than one spatial dimension, then we can have \emph{rotation}, as in
\subfigref{congruence-vs-conservation}{3}. These world-lines could represent a constellation
of orbiting satellites, or fixed points in a rotating laboratory.

The other interesting possibility, if there is more than one spatial dimension, is \emph{shear},
figure \subfigref{congruence-vs-conservation}{4}. Here the rectangular group of four particles contracts in
one direction while expanding in the other so as to keep the enclosed 2-volume constant.

In order to discuss these possibilities, it is convenient to define the notion of a timelike congruence,\index{congruence}
which is a set of nonintersecting, smooth, timelike world-lines whose union constitutes all the events in
some region of spacetime. That is,
we ``fill in'' spacetime with an infinite number of world-lines so that there is no space between them.
This is something like the grain in a piece of wood, or Faraday's conception of field lines filling
space, except that one of our $n+1$ dimensions is timelike, and the lines aren't allowed to point in
directions that lie outside the light cone. One way to specify a congruence is to give the normalized velocity
vector that is tangent to the world-line passing through any given point.

\begin{eg}{An expanding congruence}\label{eg:exponential-congruence}
As an example of a congruence in $1+1$ dimensions, consider the set of all curves of the form
$x=ae^{bt}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. It would look like figure
\subfigref{congruence-vs-conservation}{2}. Letting $u=\der x/\der t=abe^{bt}$,
the velocity vector is $v^\lambda=\gamma^{-1}(1,u)$, where the factor of $\gamma^{-1}=\sqrt{1-u^2}$
gives the proper normalization $v^\lambda v_\lambda=1$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A boring congruence}\label{eg:boring-congruence}
Suppose we instead let the congruence consist of the set of all curves of the form $x=c+ut$, where $c$ and $u$ are
constants and $|u|<1$. Then as in example \ref{eg:exponential-congruence},
$v^\lambda=\gamma^{-1}(1,u)$. The world-lines are inertial and parallel to one another.
\end{eg}

<% end_sec('congruences') %>
<% begin_sec("Expansion and rigidity",nil,'expansion') %>

For the remainder of this discussion, we restrict ourselves to the $1+1$-dimensional case, so that
rotation and shear are impossible, and the only interesting question is whether a given congruence
has expansion. In $1+1$ dimensions, the congruence can be specified by giving the function $u(x,t)$,
where as in examples \ref{eg:exponential-congruence} and \ref{eg:boring-congruence},
$u=\der x/\der t$. If $u$ is constant, then we have example \ref{eg:boring-congruence}, and
clearly there is no expansion. Thus expansion requires either $\partial u/\partial t$ or
$\partial u/\partial x$, or both, to be nonzero.

Figure \subfigref{expansion}{1} shows the case where
$\partial u/\partial x=0$ and $\partial u/\partial t\ne0$. Each world-line is a copy of the others that has been
shifted spatially, and the two velocity vectors shown as arrows are equal.
This is precisely Bell's spaceship paradox
(section \ref{subsec:bell-spaceship-paradox}, p.~\pageref{subsec:bell-spaceship-paradox}).
Although the horizontal spacing between the world-lines remains constant as defined by the fixed
frame of reference used for the diagram, an observer accelerating along with one of the particles
would find that they had expanded away from one another, because 
the observer's meter-sticks have Lorentz-contracted. This is a real expansion in the sense that
if the world-lines are particles in a solid object, the object comes under increasing tension.

In \subfigref{expansion}{2} we have $\partial u/\partial t=0$ and $\partial u/\partial x\ne0$. The world-lines
are copies of one another that have been shifted temporally. 
The two velocity vectors in the diagram are the same.
All of the particles began accelerating
from the same point in space, but at different times. Here there is clearly an expansion, because
the world-lines are getting farther apart. 

Suppose that we accelerate a rigid object such as a ruler. Then we must have something like
\subfigref{expansion}{3}. To avoid the situations described in \subfigref{expansion}{1} and
\subfigref{expansion}{2}, the velocity vector must vary with both $t$ and $x$; the three velocity
vectors in the figure are all different. As the particles accelerate, the spacing between them
Lorentz-contracts, so that an observer accelerating along with them sees the spacing as remaining
constant.

This notion of rigid motion in relativity is called Born rigidity.\index{Born rigidity}\index{rigidity}
No physical substance can naturally be perfectly rigid (Born rigid),
for if it were, then the speed at which sound
waves traveled in it would be greater than $c$. Born rigidity can only be accomplished 
through a set of external forces applied at all points on the object according
to a program that has been planned in advance. A real object such as a ruler does not maintain
its own Born-rigidity, but it will
eventually return to its original size and shape after having undergone relativistic acceleration,
due to its own elastic properties, provided that the acceleration has been gentle enough to
avoid permanently damaging it. In $1+1$ dimensions, Born rigidity is equivalent to a lack of
expansion. In $3+1$ dimensions, we also require vanishing shear.

Mathematically, it is clear that the condition of vanishing expansion must be expressible
in $1+1$ dimensions in terms of the partial derivatives $\partial u/\partial t$ and $\partial u/\partial x$,
and since we have been able to describe the condition in a frame-independent way (by referring
it to observations made by the comoving observer), it should also be something we can
express as a scalar within the grammar of index gymnastics. There is only one possible way
to express such a condition, which is
\begin{equation*}
  \partial_a v^a = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We can in fact define a scalar $\Theta$, called the expansion scalar,\index{expansion scalar}
according to
\begin{equation*}
  \Theta = \partial_a v^a\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This definition is valid in $n+1$ dimensions, but in $1+1$ dimensions it reduces
to $\Theta=\partial\gamma/\partial t+\partial(u\gamma)/\partial x$.

The expansion scalar
is interpreted as the fractional rate of change in the volume of a set of particles that move
along the world-lines defined by the congruence, where the rate of change is defined with
respect to the proper time $\tau$ of an observer moving along with the particles.
For example, cosmological expansion leads to a fractional
increase in the distances between galaxies $\Delta L/L$ which,
for a small time interval $\Delta \tau$, is equal to $H_\zu{o}\Delta \tau$, where 
$H_\zu{o}$, called the Hubble constant, is about $2.3\times 10^{-18}\ \sunit^{-1}$.
That is, the fractional rate of change is $(1/L)\der L/\der \tau=H_\zu{o}$. Because distances expand in all
three spatial dimensions, the fractional rate of change of volume is
$\Theta=(1/V)\der V/\der \tau=3H_\zu{o}$. (In this example, spacetime is not flat, so
we would have to express $\Theta$ in terms of the covariant derivative $\nabla_a$
defined in section \ref{sec:covariant-derivative}, not the partial derivative $\partial_a$.)

\begin{eg}{A catastrophe}\label{eg:catastrophe}
Consider the timelike congruence in $1+1$ dimensions defined by $u=x/t$. This consists of the set of all inertial
world-lines passing through the origin. Since our definition of a congruence requires that the world-lines
be non-intersecting, let's restrict this example to the interior of the past light cone of the origin,
$|x|<-t$. We have a universe full of hapless particles, all heading like lemmings toward a catastrophic
collision. The spacetime diagram looks like an optical ray diagram for the formation of a real image.
A computation gives the unexpectedly simple result $\Theta=\gamma/t$. For $t<0$, this is negative,
indicating a contraction, and it blows up to minus infinity as $t$ approaches $0$.

The apex of the cone in example \ref{eg:catastrophe} is a \emph{caustic.}\index{caustic}
Given a space-filling set of straight lines, a caustic occurs where their intensity diverges to infinity.
The word means ``burning,'' because in optics a caustic of light rays concentrates energy and can burn things.
Example \ref{eg:catastrophe} involves a caustic of timelike world-lines, and ``straight'' is to be interpreted as meaning
that the world-lines are inertial. 

Figure \figref{rindler-caustic} shows  two caustics formed by spacelike
lines for the accelerated coordinate system described in \ref{sec:rindler-coords}.
Here, as is often the case, the caustics are not just points.

An example from general relativity is that when a black hole forms by gravitational collapse,
a caustic is formed at a one point by the set of lightlike world-lines that enter the event horizon
from the outside universe at the moment when the horizon is formed.
If a ray of light is emitted from this caustic point, it remains on the event horizon forever,
as do all rays emitted at the horizon in the outward direction at later times. The event horizon is the
same set of events as the union of all the lightlike world-lines that enter the horizon at the 
caustic.\footnote{Penrose, 1968. The proof is presented in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, p. 924}

<% begin_sec("The Herglotz-Noether theorem in 1+1 dimensions",nil,'herglotz-noether') %>\index{Herglotz-Noether theorem}

Certain Born-rigid types of motion
are possible, and others are not, purely as a matter of kinematics. It turns out to be possible
to accelerate a rod in a Born-rigid way along its own length (problem \ref{hw:rindler-expansion},
p.~\pageref{hw:rindler-expansion}), but surprisingly, it is not possible, for example, for a sphere to remain
Born-rigid while simultaneously rotating and having its center of mass accelerated.
The possible types of motion are delineated by a theorem called the Herglotz-Noether theorem.
Unlike the $3+1$-dimensional version of the theorem,
the $1+1$-dimensional version is neither surprising nor difficult to state or prove.

\emph{Herglotz-Noether theorem in 1+1 dimensions:} Any rigid motion in $1+1$ dimensions is uniquely
determined by the world-line W of one point, provided that the world-line of that point is smooth and timelike.
It is in general only possible to extend the congruence describing the motion to some neighborhood of W.

Proof: To avoid technical issues, we assume that ``smooth'' means analytic, which slightly weakens the result.
As discussed above, zero expansion is equivalent to
$0=\partial\gamma/\partial t+\partial(u\gamma)/\partial x$, where $(t,x)$ are any set of Minkowski coordinates.
This can be put in the form $\partial u/\partial x=f(u)\partial u/\partial t$, where $f$ is smooth for $-1<u<1$
and $f(0)=0$.
We need to prove that the solution
of this partial differential equation, if it exists, is unique given W.
We arbitrarily choose one event on W.
By assumption, W is timelike at this point, so we are free to choose our Minkowski coordinates
such that our point is at rest at this event at the origin. Since $f(0)=0$, it follows that
at the origin $\partial u/\partial x=0$. We can similarly evaluate the higher derivatives
$\partial^n u/\partial x^n$, and because $u$ is smooth we can in this calculation freely interchange the order
of the partial derivatives $\partial_x$ and $\partial_t$. It is straightforward to  show that these higher derivatives
$\partial^n u/\partial x^n$ are also zero. Since $u(x)$ is assumed to be analytic, it follows that $u(0,x)=0$ for
all $x$, i.e., an observer instantaneously moving along W at $t=0$ says that all other points are at rest
as well at that time. But because W is timelike, we can always find some neighborhood A of W such that
every point in A is simultaneous with a unique event on W
according to an observer at that event moving
along with W. (Cf.~p.~\pageref{subsubsec:deja-vu-again}.) Therefore the value of $u$ is determined 
everywhere in A, and this completes the proof that the congruence exists and is unique in A.

Remarks: 
(1) The $1+1$-dimensional version of the Herglotz-Noether theorem is not a special case of
the $3+1$-dimensional version. The latter is usually proved for a space-filling congruence,
and it fails when the body in question does not enclose a volume, e.g., in the case of a thin rod
or a letter ``C.''

(2) The theorem can be strengthened by relaxing the requirement of smoothness so that only
the existence of a second derivative of the position with respect to proper time is 
required.\footnote{Giulini, ``The Rich Structure of Minkowski Space,'' \url{arxiv.org/abs/0802.4345},
theorems 18 and 22}

(3) If the motion is accelerated, then
the rigid motion cannot be extended to an arbitrary distance from W.
If the proper acceleration of W can be as great as $a$, then as in
example \ref{eg:deja-vu-again}, p.~\pageref{eg:deja-vu-again}, we expect to be able to
extend the rigid motion to a proper distance only as big as $c^2/a$, where there will be a caustic
similar to the one in figure \figref{rindler-caustic}.

<% begin_sec("Bell's spaceship paradox revisited",nil,'bell-revisited') %>\index{Bell's spaceship paradox}%
\index{spaceship paradox}\index{paradox!Bell's spaceship}
Bell's spaceship paradox was discussed in section \ref{subsec:bell-spaceship-paradox}
on p.~\pageref{subsec:bell-spaceship-paradox}.
In the paradox, two spaceships begin accelerating simultaneously and
have equal accelerations in the frame of an external, inertial observer,
causing a thread stretched between them breaks. We now give a more rigorous and mathematically elegant demonstration of the
same result, suggested by P.~Allen.

The motion of the thread throughout its length can be described by a timelike congruence.
If the thread is not to come under any strain, then this must be a Born-rigid congruence.
By the $1+1$-dimensional Herglotz-Noether theorem, the congruence is uniquely determined by
the motion of one of its points, which we take to be the trailing rocket. This congruence
happens to be known. It is defined by the system of accelerated coordinates
(Rindler coordinates)  described in
section \ref{sec:rindler-coords}, p.~\pageref{sec:rindler-coords}. The vanishing of the
expansion scalar for this congruence is left for the reader to verify (problem
\ref{hw:rindler-expansion}, p.~\pageref{hw:rindler-expansion}). But this congruence consists of
world-lines whose proper accelerations are each constant and all different from one another,
and this is inconsistent with the description given in the Bell paradox, where it is stated
that a frame exists in which the motions of the two ships are identical except for a translation. Therefore the
thread cannot move rigidly.

This completes the resolution fo the paradox, but as an illustrative example, we present an explicit
calculation of the expansion scalar for the congruence that one would most naturally imagine to be implied
by the description of the paradox. This is given by
$(x+c)^2=1+t^2$. For a given value of the parameter $c$, we get an accelerating
world-line. (Its proper acceleration $a=1$ happens to be constant, example \ref{eg:hyperbolic-motion}, 
p.~\pageref{eg:hyperbolic-motion}, although this is not necessary for the purposes of discussing the paradox.)
Each world-line starts at rest at $t=0$, and each one has the same acceleration at any given $t$.
By picking any two distinct values of $c$ as the endpoints of the thread,
we obtain the literal situation described in the paradox.

Implicit differentiation gives $u=t/\sqrt{1+t^2}$. The algebra gets a little messy now, so I used the open-source
computer algebra system Maxima. The following program, which should be fairly readable without previous
knowledge of Maxima's syntax, calculates the expansion tensor:

\begin{listing}{1}
u:t/sqrt(1+t^2);
gamma:1/sqrt(1-u^2);
theta:diff(gamma,t)+diff(u*gamma,x);
is(equal(theta,gamma*u^2/t));
\end{listing}

The third line prints out a complicated expression for $\Theta$, which the fourth line shows can be
simplified to $\gamma u^2/t$. This is positive for $t>0$, which shows that the thread is forced to expand.
Note that although the calculation was carried out in a particular set of coordinates, a relativistic scalar
such as $\Theta$ has a coordinate-independent value. Reference to a particular coordinate system or
frame of reference occurs only in the initial definition of the congruence, which is defined in order
to model the situation described in the paradox, which is stated in terms of a particular external observer.

<% begin_sec("Units of measurement for tensors",nil,'tensor-units') %>\index{units!for tensors}
Analyzing units, also known as dimensional analysis, is one of the
first things we learn in freshman physics.  It's a useful way of
checking our math, and it seems as though it ought to be
straightforward to extend the technique to relativity. It certainly
can be done, but it isn't quite as trivial as might be imagined. We'll
see below that different authors prefer differing systems, and clashes
occur between some of the notational systems in use.

One of our most common jobs is to change from one set of units to
another, but in relativity it becomes nontrivial to define what we
mean by the notion that our units of measurement change or don't
change. We could, e.g., appeal to an
atomic standard, but Dicke\footnote{``Mach's principle and invariance
under transformation of units,'' Phys Rev 125 (1962) 2163} points out
that this could be problematic. Imagine, he says, that
%
\begin{quote}
you are told by a space traveller that a
hydrogen atom on Sirius has the same diameter as one on the earth. A
few moments' thought will convince you that the statement is either a
definition or else meaningless. 
\end{quote}
%
(Some related ideas about the numerical value of $c$ were discussed on p.~\pageref{subsubsec:numerical-c}.)

To start with, we note that abstract index notation is more convenient than concrete index notation for these purposes.
As noted in section \ref{sec:xfn-derivatives}, p.~\pageref{sec:xfn-derivatives},
concrete index notation assigns different units to different components of a tensor if
we use coordinates, such as spherical coordinates $(t,r,\theta,\phi)$, that don't
all have units of length.
In abstract index notation, a symbol like $v^i$ stands for the whole vector, not for one of its components.
Since abstract index notation does not even offer us a notation for components, if we want to
apply dimensional analysis we must define a system in which units are attributed to a tensor as
a whole. Suppose we write down the abstract-index form of the equation for proper time:
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = g_{ab} \der x^a \der x^a
\end{equation*}
In abstract index notation, $\der x^a$ doesn't mean an infinitesimal change in a particular coordinate, it
means an infinitesimal displacement vector.\footnote{For a modern and rigorous development of differential
geometry along these lines, see Nowik and Katz, 
\url{arxiv.org/abs/1405.0984}.} This equation
has one quantity on the left and three factors on the right. Suppose we assign these parts of the equation units
$[ds]=L^\sigma$, $[g_{ab}]=L^{2 \gamma}$, and $[dx^a]=[dx^b]=L^\xi$, where square brackets mean
``the units of'' and $L$ stands for units of length. We then have $\sigma=\gamma+\xi$.
Due to the ambiguities referred to above, we can pick any values we like for these three constants,
as long as they obey this rule. I find $(\sigma,\gamma,\xi)=(1,0,1)$ to be natural and convenient,
but Dicke, in the above-referenced paper, likes $(1,1,0)$, while the well known mathematician
Terry Tao advocates $(0,\mp 1,\pm 1)$.

Suppose we raise and lower indices to form a tensor with $r$ upper indices and $s$ lower indices
We refer to this as a tensor of rank $(r,s)$.\index{tensor!rank}
(We don't count contracted indices, e.g., $u^av_a$ is a rank-$(0,0)$ scalar.)
 Since the metric is the tool we use for raising and
lowering indices, and the units of the lower-index form of the metric are $L^{2 \gamma}$,
it follows that the 
units vary in proportion to $L^{\gamma(s-r)}$. In general, you can
assign a physical quantity units $L^u$ that are a product of two
factors, a ``kinematical'' or purely geometrical factor $L^k$, where
$k=\gamma(s-r)$, and a dynamical factor $L^d\ldots$, which can
depend on what kind of quantity it is, and where the \ldots indicates
that if your system of units has more than just one base unit, those
can be in there as well. Dicke uses units with $\hbar=c=1$, for
example, so there is only one base unit, and mass has units of inverse
length and $d_\text{mass}=-1$. In general relativity it would be more common to use units
in which $G=c=1$, which instead give $d_\text{mass}=+1$.

\begin{eg}{The units of momentum}\label{eg:units-of-momentum-fancy}
Consider the equation
\begin{equation*}
  p^a = mv^a
\end{equation*}
for the momentum of a material particle. Suppose we use special-relativistic units
in which $c=1$, but because gravity isn't incorporated into the theory, $G$ plays
no special role, and it is natural to use a system of units in which there is a base
unit of mass $M$.

The kinematic units check out, because $k_p=k_m+k_v$:
\begin{equation*}
  \gamma(-1)=\gamma(0)+\gamma(-1)
\end{equation*}
This is merely a matter of counting indices, and was guaranteed to check out as long
as the indices were written in a grammatical way on both sides of the equation.
What this check is essentially telling us is that if we were to establish Minkowski
coordinates in a neighborhood of some point, and do a change of coordinates
$(t,x,y,z)\rightarrow(\alpha t,\alpha x,\alpha y,\alpha z)$, then the quantities on both sides of the equation
would vary under the tensor transformation laws according to the same exponent of $\alpha$. For example,
if we changed from meters to centimeters, the equation would still remain valid.

For the dynamical units, suppose that we use $(\sigma,\gamma,\xi)=(1,0,1)$, so that
an infinitesimal displacement $\der x^a$ has units of length $L$,
as does proper time $\der s$. These two quantities are purely kinematic, so we don't
assign them any dynamical units, and therefore
the velocity vector $v^a=\der x^a/\der s$ also has no dynamical units.
Our choice of a system of units gives $[m]=M$.
We require that the equation $p^a = mv^a$ have dynamical units that check out, so:
\begin{equation*}
  M=1\cdot M
\end{equation*}
We must also assign units of mass to the momentum.
\end{eg}

A system almost identical to this one, but with different terminology, is given by
Schouten.\footnote{Tensor Analysis for Physicists, ch.~VI}

For practical purposes in checking the units of an equation, we can see from
example \ref{eg:units-of-momentum-fancy} that worrying about the kinematic units is
a waste of time as long as we have checked that the indices are grammatical. We can therefore
give a simplified method that suffices for checking the units of any equation in abstract index
notation.

\begin{enumerate}\label{tensor-unit-rules}
\item We assign a tensor the same units that one of its concrete
    components \emph{would} have if we were to adopt (local) Minkowski coordinates,
    in the system with $(\sigma,\gamma,\xi)=(1,0,1)$. These are the units
    we would automatically have imputed to it after learning special relativity but before
    learning about tensors or fancy coordinate transformations. Since $\gamma=0$, the positions
    of the indices do not affect the result.
\item The units of a sum are the same as the units of the terms.
\item The units of a tensor product are the product of the units of the factors.

Johnny is an American grade-school kid who has had his tender mind protected from certain historical realities,
such as the political status of slaves, women, and Native Americans in the early United States. If Johnny ever
tries to read the U.S.~Constitution, he will be very confused by certain passages,
such as the infamous three-fifths clause referring opaquely to ``all other persons.''

This optional section is meant to expose you to some similar historical ugliness involving tensor notation,
knowledge of which may be helpful if you learn general relativity in the future.
As in the evolution of the U.S.~Constitution and its interpretation, we will find that not all the
changes have been improvements. In sections
\ref{subsec:tensor-notation-dark-ages}-\ref{subsec:tensor-notation-abstract-index} we briefly recapitulate
some notations that have already been introduced, and then in sections
\ref{subsec:tensor-notation-cartan}-\ref{subsec:tensor-notation-index-free} we introduce two new ones.

<% begin_sec("Concrete index notation",nil,'tensor-notation-dark-ages') %>
A displacement vector is our prototypical example of a tensor, and the original nineteenth-century
approach was to associate this tensor with the changes in the coordinates. Tensors achieve their
full importance in differential geometry, where space (or spacetime, in general relativity) may be
curved, in the sense defined in section \ref{sec:flatness}, p.~\pageref{sec:flatness}. In this
context, only infinitesimally small displacements qualify as vectors; to see this, imagine
displacements on a sphere, which do not commute for the reasons described
in section \ref{subsec:rot-noncommutative}, p.~\pageref{subsec:rot-noncommutative}. On small scales,
the sphere's curvature is not apparent, which is why we need to make our displacements infinitesimal.
Thus in this approach, the simplest example of a relativistic tensor occurs if we pick Minkowski
coordinates to describe a region of spacetime that is small enough for the curvature to be negligible,
and we associate a displacement vector with a 4-tuple of infinitesimal changes in the coordinates:
\begin{equation*}
  (\der t,\der x,\der y,\der z) 
\end{equation*}
Until about 1960, this carried the taint of the lack of rigor believed to be associated with Leibniz-style
infinitesimal numbers, but this difficulty was resolved and is no longer an argument against the 
notation.\footnote{For a thorough development of the ``back-to-the-future'' use of infinitesimals
for this purpose, see Nowik and Katz, \url{arxiv.org/abs/1405.0984}.}

A more valid reason for disliking the old-school notation is that,
as described in ch.~\ref{ch:coordinates}, p.~\pageref{ch:coordinates}, it
is desirable to avoid writing every line of mathematics in a notation that explicitly refers
to a choice of coordinates. We might therefore prefer, as Penrose began advocating around
1970, to notate this vector in coordinate-independent
notation such as ``birdtracks'' (section \ref{subsec:birdtracks}, p.~\pageref{subsec:birdtracks}),
\begin{equation*}
  __birdvec(\der\vc{x})\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
or the synonymous abstract index notation (section \ref{subsec:abstract-index}, p.~\pageref{subsec:abstract-index}),
\begin{equation*}
  \der x^a\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the use of the Latin letter $a$ means that we're not referring to any coordinate system, $a$ doesn't
take on values such as 1 or 2, and $\der x^a$ refers to the entire object $__birdvec(\der\vc{x})$, not
to some real number or set of real numbers.

Unfortunately for the struggling student of relativity, there are at least two more notations now in use,
both of them incompatible in various ways with the ones we've encountered so far.

<% begin_sec("Cartan notation",nil,'tensor-notation-cartan') %>
Our notation involving upper and lower indices is descended from a similar-looking one
invented in 1853 by Sylvester.\footnote{An easily obtainable modern description is given in
Coxeter, \emph{Introduction to Geometry}.} In this system, 
vectors are thought of as invariant quantities.
We write a vector in terms of a basis $\{\vc{e}_\mu\}$ as $\vc{x}=\sum x^\mu \vc{e}_\mu$. 
Since $\vc{x}$ is considered invariant, it follows that the components $x^\mu$ and the basis
vectors $\vc{e}_\mu$ must transform in opposite ways. For example, if we convert from
meters to centimeters, the $x^\mu$ get a hundred times bigger, which is compensated for by
a corresponding shrinking of the basis vectors by $1/100$.

This notation clashes with normal index notation in certain ways.
One gotcha is that we can't infer the rank of an expression by counting indices.
For example,
$\vc{x}=\sum x^\mu \vc{e}_\mu$ is notated as if it were a scalar, but this is 
actually a notation for a vector.

Circa 1930, \'Elie Cartan augmented this notation with a trick that is perhaps a little
too cute for its own good. He noted that the partial differentiation operators $\partial/\partial x^\mu$
could be used as a basis for a vector space whose structure is the same as the space of ordinary vectors.
In the modern context we rewrite the operator $\partial/\partial x^\mu$ as $\partial_\mu$ and
use the Einstein summation convention, so that in the Cartan notation we express a vector in terms of its components as
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{x} = x^\mu \partial_\mu\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

In the Cartan notation, the symbol $\der x^\mu$ is hijacked in order to represent something
completely different than it normally does; it's taken to mean the dual vector corresponding
to $\partial_\mu$. The set $\{\der x^\mu\}$ is used as a  basis for notating covectors.

A further problem with the Cartan notation arises when we try to use it for dimensional
analysis (see section \ref{subsec:cartan-no-units}).

<% end_sec('tensor-notation-cartan') %>

<% begin_sec("Index-free notation",nil,'tensor-notation-index-free') %>
Independently of Penrose and the physics community, mathematicians invented
a different coordinate-free notation, one without indices. In this notation, for example,
we would notate the magnitude of a vector not as $v_av^b$ or $g_{ab}v^av^b$ but as
\begin{equation*}
  g(\vc{v},\vc{v})\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This notation is too clumsy for use in complicated expressions involving tensors with many indices.
As shown in section \ref{subsec:cartan-no-units}, it is also not compatible with the way physicists are accustomed to doing
dimensional analysis. 
<% end_sec('tensor-notation-index-free') %>

<% begin_sec("Incompatibility of Cartan and index-free notation with dimensional analysis",nil,'cartan-no-units') %>
In section \ref{sec:tensor-units} we developed a system of dimensional analysis for use with abstract index notation.
Here we discuss the issues that arise when we attempt to mix in other notational systems.

One of the hallmarks of index-free notation is that it
uses non-multiplicative notation for many tensor products that would have been written as multiplication
in index notation, e.g., $g(\vc{v},\vc{v})$ rather than $v^av_a$. This makes the system clumsy to use
for dimensional analysis, since we are accustomed to reasoning about units based on the assumption that
the units of any term in an equation equal the product of the units of its factors.

In Cartan notation we have the problem that certain notations, such as $dx^\mu$, are completely redefined.
The remainder of this section is devoted to exploring what goes wrong when
we attempt to extend the analysis of section \ref{sec:tensor-units} to include Cartan notation.
Let vector $\vc{r}$ and covector $\bomega$ be duals of each other, and let $\vc{r}$ represent a displacement.
In Cartan notation, we write these vectors in terms of their components, in some coordinate system, as
follows:
\begin{align}
\vc{r}      &=r^\mu \partial_\mu \label{eq:cartan-r-in-basis} \\
\bomega &=\omega_\mu dx^\mu \label{eq:cartan-omega-in-basis}
\end{align}
Suppose that the coordinates are Minkowski. Reading from left to right and from top to bottom, there are
six quantities occurring in these equations. We attribute to them the units $L^A$, $L^B$, \ldots $L^F$.
If we follow the rule that multiplicative notation is to imply multiplication of units, then
\begin{align}
  A &= B+C \qquad \text{and} \\
  D &= E+F\eqquad.
\end{align}
For compatibility with the system in section \ref{sec:tensor-units}, equations 
\ref{eq:cartan-r-in-basis}-\ref{eq:cartan-omega-in-basis} require
\begin{align}
  &A+D=2\sigma \qquad \text{and} \\
  &D=2\gamma+B\eqquad.
\end{align}
To avoid a clash between Cartan and concrete index notation in a Minkowski coordinate system,
it would appear that we want the following three additional conditions.
\begin{align}
  F&=\xi \qquad \text{units of Cartan $dx^\mu$ not to clash with units of $dx^\mu$} \\
  C&=-\xi \qquad \text{units of Cartan $\partial_\mu$ not to clash with units of the derivative} \\
  B&=\xi \qquad \text{units of components in Cartan notation not to clash with units of $dx^\mu$}
\end{align}
We have 6 unknowns and 7 constraints, so in general Cartan notation cannot be incorporated into this
system without some constraint on the exponents $(\sigma,\gamma,\xi)$. In particular, we require $\xi=0$,
which is not a choice that most physicists prefer.

<% begin_hw('delta-g-notational-conflict') %>
This problem investigates a notational conflict in the description of the metric tensor using index notation.
Suppose that we have two different metrics, $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $g'_{\mu\nu}$. The difference of two rank-2
tensors is also a rank-2 tensor, so we would like the quantity $\delta g_{\mu\nu}=g'_{\mu\nu}-g_{\mu\nu}$
to be a well-behaved tensor both in its transformation properties and in its behavior when we manipulate its
indices. Now we also have $g^{\mu\nu}$ and $g'^{\mu\nu}$, which are defined as the matrix inverses of their
lower-index counterparts; this is a special property of the metric, not of rank-2 tensors in general. We can
then define $\delta g^{\mu\nu}=g'^{\mu\nu}-g^{\mu\nu}$.
(a) Use a simple example to show that $\delta g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$ cannot be computed from one
another in the usual way by raising and lowering indices.
(b) Find the general relationship between $\delta g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$.

<% begin_hw('rindler-expansion') %>
In section \ref{subsec:bell-revisited} on p.~\pageref{subsec:bell-revisited}, we analyzed the Bell spaceship paradox
using the expansion scalar and the Herglotz-Noether theorem.
Suppose that we carry out a similar analysis, but with the congruence defined by
$x^2-t^2=a^{-2}$. The motivation for considering this congruence is that its world-lines have constant
proper acceleration $a$, and each such world-line has a constant value of the coordinate $X$ in the
system of accelerated coordinates (Rindler coordinates)  described in
section \ref{sec:rindler-coords}, p.~\pageref{sec:rindler-coords}.
Show that the expansion tensor vanishes. The interpretation is that it is possible to
apply a carefully planned set of external forces to a straight rod so that
it accelerates along its own length without any stress, i.e., while remaining Born-rigid.
