producing pdf output
=================================================================
Compiling the book into pdf format is fairly easy on a Linux
machine. Basically you just need to install some open-source
software. The following are the relevant packages on a Debian-based
system such as Ubuntu:
  texlive-full qpdf m4 inkscape ruby1.9

Make sure you have at least inkscape 0.47 and ruby 1.9. As of
January 2010, ruby 1.9 is the stable version, and it's available
in the ruby1.9 package in ubuntu 9.10 (karmic koala). To test
whether your version of ruby is new enough to use, do this:
  make test_ruby
If you need to upgrade, you can download 1.9 from:
  http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

Go to the main directory (the one where you found this README).

Make all the files in the scripts directory exectable:
  chmod +x scripts/*

Convert all the figures from editable svg format to pdf format:
  make all_figures

Produce pdf output of all the books:
  make

I haven't tried compiling the books on MacOS X or Windows. I suspect
it could be done on MacOS X without any heroic measures, and I suspect
that it would be a real pain on Windows.

=================================================================
producing html output
=================================================================
To produce html output requires a little more software. First, you
need the following additional Debian packages:
  xpdf imagemagick tex4ht dvipng
(The xpdf dependency is because of pdftoppm, which comes bundled
with it.)

You'll also need footex:
